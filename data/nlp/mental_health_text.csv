Descreva brevemente o que você acha que o setor como um todo e/ou empregadores poderia fazer para melhorar o apoio à saúde mental aos funcionários.
They don't take it seriously
"raise awareness, talk about it to lessen the stigma"
"Education and awareness, statistics, add supportive writing to the company handbook"
"More support, less burnout and death marches"
I think tech is more internal and they don't really talk about feelings or issues.
"Awareness, changed work schedules and expectations"
"Be more vocal about supporting employees with issues, and supporting mental health time off."
I think we over work ourselves and each other. We expect everyone to be connected all the time and humans just weren't meant to work to this degree. We need to cut each other more slack
Don’t know 
ok
Be open about talking about and open about accommodations for it and stop pushing workers toward burnout. 
"Make employees more aware of any programs they have options to, STOP firing people that have these problems rather then deal with it. Realize that just because someone might miss a lot of work its not because they are lazy. With me its because of stress and depression. My job is almost nothing but pressure/stress and trying to make everything perfect. I'm a QA and the entire companies software dependability rests on my shoulders alone. "
"I think that the opportunity to have mental health sick leave should be just as important as normal sick leave. Also, burnout is a huge issue in tech."
3
More awareness both for ability to find treatment and also what employee options are in the workplace
important
Raise awareness and offer services
Awareness & open talks to lower the obstacle of talking about it.
"Speaking more openly without judgement is a great start I find. And educating people is of utmost importance. 
If one is educated on a subject, they know what to expect. The unknown makes people defensive and apprehensive I think. Not to mention stereotypes being perceived as facts. "
Be more open to actively discussing mental health and what resources are available internally and externally.
Be more open about mental health issues and offer support to this in need.
We have ZERO coverage for any mental health counselling. It all comes from a shared pool of physio / massage yearly allowance. Which is mere 1000 a year. 
x
I feel like just providing easier access to and more information in general about mental health resources would go a long way.
"I think that the industry provides appropriate benefits and that attitudes are accepting of differences. However, the tech industry is notoriously stressful, and likely to exacerbate difficulties."
"Much increased spending / education on better understanding mental health, generally, how and in what ways these diseases affect the afflicted, coupled with an unwavering commitment to provide the support so long as the employee keeps his / her end of the bargain "
"Be into it at all. Tech companies jump at the chance to participate in drinking events but mental health events are not considered. Also, conferences and meetups could be less alcohol focused. People who take medication for a disorder or who are in recovery cannot drink; we are woefully forgetful of this fact. Consider offering sparkling cider and other non-alcoholic, non-water beverages at your next meetup.

Very few companies offer employees time during work hours to take care of personal things. Most doctors do not work outside business hours, it is hard to go to therapy and have a full time job."
More proactive open discussions.
Knowing about mental health issue appears in everywhere in the industry. Know the reality.
"Open dialogs about mental health, a cutback on hours, less of a reliance on alcohol for social events."
Recognizing that people have problems and give them time to deal with them. The same time it would be for going to see a physical doctor or a dentist.
More focus on personal time and well being.
Need programs like OSMI.
"Get some LCSW's in there to talk with folks. A lot of IT folks have the same issues going on, and the same personalities, and concerns. It's why they all end up in a room geeking out together, with the same conflicts. "
Remove the stigma of it being a condition of hiring or continued employment.
more proactive support & education
Generally be open about resources and the commonness of Mental Health issues.
"Clients (of agencies, etc.) are less forgiving of mental illness than are tech companies or agencies. Outdated project management methodologies (waterfall) and management techniques create a stressful, every-man-for-himself atmosphere in which a mentally ill person inevitably loses out."
"I think rules should be established and enforced around break times, rest, and vacation, as they would have been for factory work. The tech industry has ground down any advances made with labour laws with regards to well-being."
"just talk and listen, discuss together, provide health benefit"
Being open and honest from the start.  Expressing that it doesn't mean you are a bad employee.  They should also openly provide resources for help.
"General wellness programs, talking openly about, which is something I see more and more"
Just acceptation 
"Mandatory, supported vacation AND sick days. Allow leadership tracks that still support doing technical work/direct contribution. Train managers and employees about signs of depression and burnout. Create cultures of recognition of all roles contributions, not just developers."
Not sure
Recognise and address the Global issues of CVS or Screen Fatigue (Asthenopia) by risk assessing the DSE as well as just the furniture !
They see the employees daily for weeks and years on end. Providing that information or notation of behavioral anomalies could allow the employee to make a better judgement call on getting treatment. It could also aid doctors in figuring out if their patient needs care right away for their mental health. Put the restrictive surveillance of the employees to better use than using it to bitch at them if they take 3 minutes to go for a piss instead of 2.3 minutes.
"Training, and guidelines, may help deal with the prejudices associated with mental health issues at work."
Awareness and support. 
Empathy. Every industry should pause and consider the experiences of people with mental health issues or disorders. Only then will genuinely constructive plans be drawn that can support those people through their careers. 
Raising awareness. Group wellness activities. Top down communication and people to talk to at all levels. 
Treat is the same as a physical issue
Encourage people to be open. Encourage people with MH issues to talk about living with them yet still doing a gret job.
"Its about perception, they cannot manage their perceptions and fall for them whatever they think so first they have understand mental illness can be treated with support and care and treating the person with the same manner, so that it will not further increase"
Acknowledge when there is a lack of balance in work/life and don't tout it as a badge of honor.
"Offer better benefits, like an HSA/FSA match in recognition that behavioral health providers are rarely in network, even for the best plan options. Make it an open, concrete part of the culture that discussing mental health is acceptable without forcing any single person to disclose or discuss when they are not ready to do so."
Improve culture to lower burnout rates
Encourage more open discussion
"Listen, be compassionate, obey the law, and realize that working with an individual creates loyalty, not a shirking of duty. "
"Destigmatize it so that people don't feel like they are othered, and so that no one acts like ""no one here has mental illness/is disabled/etc"".  Find plans that don't place limits on how many times you can see a professional or what you can see a professional for (ex. autism diagnosis is covered but no follow-up therapy related to it is).  Enable spaces where (safe) open discussion can happen - mini support groups, or similar.  Spaces run by people who have the illnesses in question would be lovely."
"The industry as a whole is very stressful -- if people were placed above products, I think it would help"
"Just talk about it. Treat it like any other health issue. So many tech companies are so worried about looking “cool” or being seen as a good place to work, but only for specific types of people. The field is not inclusive in any significant way, only enough to look good on a website. I may be a little bitter. "
"Openly identify the types of mental health disorders that exist, and say the kinds of programs/policies they have in place to help them.  "
"Honestly,I don’t know. "
"Empathy, Empathy, Empathy. We are not coding robots. Know your people, create open and supportive working place."
Mental health is still a dirty secret that is misunderstood. While HR departments are good at checking boxes
"Employ, or contract, coaching with someone that has a background in both professional coaching and mental health."
"Make it feel safe(r) to discuss it. I always felt and assumed that it's not a good idea to be known to have mental health issues. Please note that I did not see others mistreated and I did not experience problems so I cannot justify this assumption --- it was ""in the air""."
Be more open about the conversation
Keep talking about it. The conversation is important for keeping it in people's minds.
Less pressure 
"Recognizing how prevalent mental illness is in the tech community is of huge importance. Far too many of us suffer in silence because despite this common experience we share, the stigmas are so powerful that we can't openly discuss the situation, demand better treatment from our superiors, or fully disclose our condition when applying for jobs."
\-
Talk about mental health benefits explicitly. Let employees know about ADA responsibilities of employers wrt disclosures and reasonable accommodation. Actually make those reasonable accommodations rather than looking for reasons to fire people.
HR is not tech and they are not kind to people with disabilities that are not mobility or vision related.
Empathy
"Its a cultural thing like Racism, or Sexism. If one looks at the media people with mental disorders are perceived in a negative way. I think it is just a lack of education. "
Education!  Education themselves about mental illness.
"I think they could talk about specific, common disorders more explicitly."
"identify people clusters, bullying, etc."
Be more ok with flexible work hours and conditions. Let the work stand for itself instead of the hours put in at specific times. 9-5 5 days a week isn't possible for everyone
It is seen as decreasing the person's capacity to operate effectively.
I think sometimes the tech industry creates isolation by default I am not sure how you can get tech guys to crawl out of their hole
"The values of the tech industry are very much focused on day-to-day productivity, which can be very difficult for people with mental health issues. My experience has been that employers are unwilling to differentiate between the performance impacts of mental health issues and other causes of low productivity. This leads to punishment and shaming, even when the company espouses support for sufferers. I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others."
Give managers training on how to help support people with mental health issues in the workplace. Facilities that are available for quiet time etc. Non-forced collaboration in development work as not everyone can handle the cognitive overhead of talking to someone else all day. Managers share their own struggles with the people they work with to destigmatise it. 
"Correct ""benevolent discrimination"" where someone ""just wants to help"" or ""didn't want to stress you out"" and effectively keeps potential work opportunities from you."
"I think that people managers must receive adequate training on coaching and providing a secure work environment for workers with mental health. If there is one major problem in the tech industry, it is that people become people managers due to their _technical skills_ rather than their coaching or interpersonal relationship skills. We have managers who are good engineers but awful communicators, coaches, and counselors. "
I think there should be an inclusive way for mental health to be addressed in the interview process where it will not negatively affect the candidate. There must be a safe way to ask a potential employer if they are able to support your needs. 
"Open to ideas, funded to support, too many aspergers jokes"
talk about it
"Reducing stigma would be great, but that's awfully vague and difficult"
More education to break through the stigma.
"They could be flexible and understand that placing individuals under duress is not healthy. They could accept that some people do not cope well with stress and need extra support. 
They could also ask what support people need, and engage the services of mental health practitioners to make suggestions for positive improvements to the work place."
"Free subscriptions to meditation apps (Headspace, Calm), and clear messaging that sick days can be used for mental health reasons, not just physical ones."
"Our industry wears exhaustion like a badge of honor and encourages people to ignore their most basic needs. There's the pressure to always be connected and it can be really toxic. Fortunately there are a few people who care and make that known, but nothing will change unless people either make it a priority when choosing employers OR those in leadership create a conversation around it. "
More info for employers

I don't know...
"The tech industry often has a competitive, startup atmosphere that breeds high stress, high pressure work environments.  More can be done to spotlight these issues and give employees the support they need to address their mental health.  That could mean offering more mental health services, or creating an office culture where it is okay to take a ""mental health day.""  "
Better education and policies with an open culture of support that I believe most do not currently have or even see as important.
come up frequent mental health checkups
no
education
"Stop stigmatising mental health and taking it as a joke or something that you ""can overcome with a bit of chocolate"""
Simply understanding would go a long way.
2
we still have a suck it up it's just typing mindset as a profession coupled with a tendency to still look at things like lack of sleep as badges of honor
"I think the fact that this survey exists is a positive sign. I am also encouraged that the open source community is pushing technology culture to be open about these issues. I strongly believe that the best technologists are creative people and creative people are more vulnerable to mental health disorders. For example, bursts of creative energy/passion can alternate with lows."
¯\(°_o)/¯ 
"Stop giving in and being controlled by fear, on both sides. Managers and above should have the responsibility to make it very obvious that mental health is strongly supported in the work place."
"Talk about it more. Make it clear that insurance covers treatment. Don't let it feel so taboo to take sick or vacation time when you are struggling mentally. A healthy brain is just as, if not more, important to knowledge work as a healthy body."
Just communicate it. It's a big problem and people need to be open and unashamed about it and know that their employers support them.
"Speak about it more openly, educate more"
"More resources, more acceptance, more conversation. I think that mental health is something people are afraid to address because of lack of knowledge and understanding about what it means to suffer from a mental illness. "
"I believe there should be a lot more education on what a mental illness is, how it might affect your day to day work, and how to discuss it in a sensitive way. I think there is a lot of misinformation and stereotypes, especially with the use of the word ""crazy"". I am guilty of that too because it is so ingrained in English. Things like ""You're crazy"" when you do something silly or say something weird for example. There is no bad intent with it, but it is still a potentially destructive word to someone struggling, especially silently. I believe education is the largest thing that could help, but instituting mental health awareness and general assistance programs could also go a long way. "
"the industry is too stressful of an environment.  need to support through emotion regulation training & prioritization of tasks so folks can stop working 24/7.  also need to respect time away (eg, just bc i have a cell phone connect 24/7 doesn't mean i need to be)"
"Talk about it openly. Talk about their issues, offer meditation classes, practice sessions, and encourage people to take them, as well as mental health days off (maybe those could be included in the contracts, singled out as separate from regula ""sick-leave"")"
"need to understand the impact of stress and anxiety, especially when facing illogical deadlines or constantly worried about layoff"
"
"
Something like company psychologist service.
"I think open conversations are helpful.  Those can only happen when work environments are supportive, and employees aren't afraid that they'll be singled out for being ""different""."
"Offering mental health benefits in the first place, offering seminars.  My current employer does a great job. They are open about mental health. Previous employers wouldn't even mention it."
"Lower the stigma associated with mental health issues, provide strong support for mental health issues."
.. 
"reduce stigma, raise awareness and training "
dont know
I would like to see leaders set an example by sharing their stories.
"Tech companies tend to exude this air of positivity, which can make it feel like you don't belong. If companies were more aware of these problems and actively provided platforms for engagement it would benefit a great many people. "
Open conversations. Patience. Options for leave which let people take time and come back instead of quitting.
"If senior management / leadership shares their own struggles with mental health issues more, it might make more people be more open about it and reduce stigma"
"Forceably turn off people's computers after 40 hours of work in a week.  The long-hours slog isn't something to be proud of, it's something companies should be ashamed of."
"Relaxation rooms, closed workspaces, accurate techspecs (if any at all), time management, fair pay."
Better payment and less extra hours... it´s just about anxiety and stress
depends on the particular illness I suppose. 
I think it is across all industry
"The employees need to feel that they can communicate openly, being trusted and understood"
"The industry should start to pay more attention to mental health problems - which is generated by the much work, overtime, and stress. One solution would be, imho, disbanding the 9am-5pm working hours and let people work when they like, or actually pay people by results instead of worked hours. Another helping factor could be to allow remote working."
People at all levels need to realize it is normal and need to share and be understanding when it affects work.
"I have a cushy job at the moment, but I haven't alway.  Everyone should have insurance and accommodations for at least a therapist appointment every week."
2
"More education, less stigma, more flexible work conditions would be nice. Less open floor plans because that is just one long PTSD trigger. x_x"
"Flexibility, allowing people to work their own way."
More open conversations.
"In US tech start-ups should offer private healthcare (UK we have National Health Service). 
Take care not to stress people over measurements such as commits/day, story points etc."
"I do not feel comfortable disclosing mental health issues due to American medical insurance (preexisting issue, could lose coverage?) and lack of legal protections for the mentally ill"
"I don't know much about the industry as a whole. From my filter bubble on social media, I see a lot of people in tech who care about this issue and who share positive and negative experiences. But I have no idea if this is a meaningful sample."
"More support, with less stigma attached to it. Be more open and accepting about it."
"It's completely a taboo topic. I've read something on the internet, but never in the workplace. There should be more focus on it."
Care about people 
I think the parts of the industry that acknowledge burnout and the dangers of hero culture are doing the industry good on this front but it needs to be more widespread.
"It a very competitive world, asking more and more each time without offer enought work place formation"
Giving more information about possible problems.
Make awarrness of the possible issues
"The stigma seems to be going away (eg in Twitter tech communities I see more well-known folks talking about mental health issues) but this still needs work. The next step imo would be more public awareness of effective treatment options: we start to recognise we (collectively) can have problems, next question is what do we do about them?"
"There are so many issues, form supporting a “hero” culture to not actively combating the factors that can contribute to burnout."
Recognizing that mental health for knowledge workers is as important as physical health for more physical occupations.
It needs to be talked about more and people need to understand that it's ok/normal. It shouldn't be where people feel like it is something wrong with them more so that a physical ailment. Obviously it's less simple than that.
"In the tech industry, clients and co-workers I told were super supportive, but I've heard of terrible experiences of others in the tech industry as well. It makes me think I may just be lucky or good at acquiring awesome clients."
Acceptance
Talk about mental health openly and continually. Remove stigma from discussing mental health. Give risk-free channels to request mental health help. 
Recognize it as no different than physical health support.
"Team members will look out for eachother, but management could do more"
"I think there could be more discussion around it, and making it okay to take time off for mental health. Otherwise they are pretty limited by the shitty health care system in the US."
"More advocacy groups, and more power for those groups to inform company awareness and policies "
"\- decrease overall pressure and workload for employes
- better work environment that is open about issues and encourages discussion such that the workplace environment is not unduly stressed 
- realistic time management and goals"
There should be less competition in promotions... Job evaluation...men should be treated equally as women...same rules for both gender...Employees should have empathy 
"I think the tech industry as a whole really only cares about burn-out and impostor syndrome. Even then, I think these two issues are paid a lot of lip service, however individuals are expected to take care of themselves, preferably outside the office.

I believe that employers should be striving to create an environment where people feel supported in the office and they have access to needed resources without any stigma. 
"
Openly offer more support and make it more accessible 
Stop treating developers like they aren't human beings. Stop expecting unrealistic deadlines and hound them to finish. Fear driven development leads to triggering these mental episodes. People with a disorder want and can function Ina. Work environment. But there has to be proper training and awareness for this in the workplace to be mindful. This in turn works out positively even for those without a diagnosis. the tech industry needs to treat people better period.
"To much hate directed towards people with mental illness, especially in the Northeastern Ohio tech community(Akron/Cleveland)"
Hire psychologists 
3
remove stigma
They should express awareness of mental health issues and that they know how people struggle with sharing and seeking help because of shame and stigma. They should value and model vulnerability and then follow through by providing support.
"some are supportive and have systems in place to support employees, others dont"
"Better understanding of how the issues can manifest in the workplace for ""hidden"" disabilities "
Reduce unrealistic deadlines that cause stress.
"don't make people have to ask for what mental health resources, benefits, etc are available. provide this info up-front and make it as accessible as possible."
I'm not sure.
"Fuck the taboo over.  Make it have equal weighting as physical wellness overall in any official documentation and openly discussed in the same sentence as physical wellness.  Ensure that an inclusive culture is promoted and take a hard line on it.  Make education programmes available, perhaps compulsory for managers."
train managers
i think i will improve
"There have been great strides recently, but if employees/ corporations would do more to help employees dealing with mental health issues, it would help."
Better health care options.
Work to remove the stigma
Just treat it the same as physical health and make big efforts to be on top of physical health.
"allow people to breathe, fail, and learn. "
duh
Offer more resources and education.
Less emphasis on always being on and always working.  Less emphasis on winning the startup lottery.  More emphasis on being whole persons and.  More emphasis on balance and creating time for yourself and your family.
"Explain that some behaviors that we have deemed successful are actually outside of mental health norms. Educate on what those types of disorders look like by example, not in abstract terms as they are diagnosed. Personal, honest accounts of dealing with it, i.e. Gregg Bauges"
"I think as it becomes more visible and people are learning, the companies are taking the lead and giving options for mental health care. "
we need care and support and open environment to discuss. people who cannot be supportive should not work here.
My current employer is great and very supportive with my illness. However I believe my employer is an exception not the rule.
"Be more proactive in identifying likely triggers for issues (stress, excessive work load, inability to adjust team composition, etc.) and avoid those.

Be more forward with educational resources and making clear what options are available to anyone having any kind of issue, be it mental condition or life-stress."
Start talking about mental health.  Educate people managers to be more aware of mental health issues and to discuss them openly.
IT/Software companies tend to be a bit better than other sectors of business
Openly listening to employees issues and referring them to appropriate organisation for support
Remove the stigma.
"I really have no idea. I know that I cant be the only one who suffers from it, maybe if people were encouraged to be open about it? There is still a pretty strong social stigma on mental illness so I dont know who that would go"
I have no thoughts to offer.
"They need to know that we have an issue like they have theirs, just because is ""trendy"" does not mean that we are special or not capable of being a good worker to have around, we all have struggles, and we know how to handle that so the company and coworkers don't suffer from it "
Increase awareness with annual talk about mental health.  Improve outreach programs.  More flexibility and less emphasis on delivery and over working.  I feel mostly that tech evangelizes working too many hours.
Put as much effort into raising awareness for this leading cause of death and disability as they do for diversity and wellness initiatives.
"Stop treating some issues (ADHD, Autism-spectrum disorders) that may or may not affect performance as badges of honor, while promoting work conditions that lead to other mental health issues (anxiety and depression) that more negatively impact workers."
Encouraging mental health as a valid reason to take a day off or some time away. Recognizing and rewarding those who take mental health seriously as much as they reward and revere those who throw it away to get stuff done. 
I think overall wellness education to be forefront in the minds of employers and provided appropriately for employees.

"
"
I don't know.
"Open discussion of mental health coverage, issues, and treatment options, without stigma, in line with similar for physical health. "
"Diversify beyond Silicon Valley and its societal values, which inherently seem to allow for mental health to be misjudged."
Hold trainings to normalize mental health issues.  To help reduce the stigma and reinforce how prevalent they actually are and how with treatment people with mental health issues are the same as everyone else.  
Having a clear mental health policy that is well known by all.  Providing privacy for discussion.  Providing anonymity for people dealing with mental health issues.  Talking about the importance of mental health.  Taking steps to ensure mental health is maintained.
"The tech industry fails to address mental health adequately by failing to recognize that mental health issues affect cognitive abilities, and those cognitive abilities are what make our jobs work."
I think competition and ego drives a lot of people to prioritize work over mental health.  The tech industry doesn't do much to discourage that practice.   There's also a ton of toxic masculinity that leads to a culture of hostility towards emotional responses or acknowledging mental illness. 
"Less stigmatism, and more understanding. Better options to seek treatment. Less expensive options for treatment."
"Make treatment options more widely known, work to decrease stigma surrounding such issues"
They could offer better benefits and estimate timelines better (or offer some flexibility) so that people are able to take time to take care of themselves
"Society as a whole doesn't understand or support mental illness. I just saw my primary care doctor at Kaiser, and he told me to ""get back to work soon"" while I am fighting for a reason to keep on going with this severe depressive episode (I have bipolar 2)"
I think a lot more conversation and openness- employers and teammates treating mental health as seriously as physical health
"I feel there's not enough awareness around mental health issues in general, nor their impact on developers. In particular, anxiety and depression can lead to a spiraling situation where one does not feel capable of doing the work. Having supportive co-workers who can both pick up the slack, as well as coach you through those times, can make a huge difference to the organization as a whole. Feeling both like you belong and are accepted is a huge step for many."
Help employees not feel ashamed of it.
Make it clear that there is no punishment or reprisal.
it's not enough to have services / benefits available. It's about actively encouraging good behaviors/positive reinforcement
?
"A work place culture that respects personal life is most important: flexible schedules, work from home, asynchronous communication that can be silenced when off duty, …. Quiet working conditions also reduce stress. Teams that enjoy working together are good for all involved."
Employers need to make a real effort to support their employees who may be going through mental health issues
"Be more open about it, talk about it."
"maybe stop with the ""indestructible tech guys"" myth, show the employees that it's ok to be vulnerable"
The most people I see in the industry don't like to talk about it. That makes it difficult to improve the support. As long as there is a safe place with people you know good it is possible.
Make explicit effort to gauge if employees have ongoing issues and how work environment/situation might impact and be impacted by that.
"Allow for recognition of crisis days , allow working from home and other flexible was to reduce impacts of issues"
"less deadlines and they should understand work is always going to be there so not to label any work as urgent and ask someone to do overtime and accept what they deliver in office hour as work for the day. lunch time to be 1 hour than 30 minutes in most offices. many of my colleagues eats at their desk staring at their emails or doing some sort of office work, not productively but i can see the stress of not being able to eat at proper lunch time and in bit of peace. "
"Good question.  Maybe they could make it more supportive for women, first?  Maybe it would help both."
"Tools, resources, open communication"
"Treat it essentially the same as physical health issues.  Make it clear that mental and physical health of employees is important, and provide information to support both."
Openly discuss and provide resources on metal health issues
"Talking more openly and normalising openness and discussion.
Have leaders speak out about their experience with mental health problems.
Mental Health First Aid programs in workplaces."
"First of all learning about it, and then talking more with his employees."
No clue
Talk about it more.
"less crunch, more time to do non-work related things."
More empathy is needed. 
Industry-wide I still don't see it talked about much outside of people  know who interact with OSMI.
Talk about it openly and often. Offer services.
Just have a base health insurance model. This applies mostly to non-EU companies.
"I think this depends on the company. My former company(ies) were pretty bad. My current company is excellent. We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased."
Educate employees about mental health and what wellness looks like. Encourage them to regularly check in with themselves and maybe complete self-assessments so they can notice if they're not doing well. Encourage open discussion about the topic to normalize it and make it easier to discuss with managers. Encourage people to take mental health days and respond positively when they say they need to.
Acceptance that these issues are real
"I think the more open we are about mental health, the better, but I also think we need to acknowledge that poor mental health is a significant liability. Knowledge work needs people with healthy minds."
"Talk about it, include it in healthcare packages, provide stress-relief tools and methods"
We have a reasonable health system in the Netherlands 
empaty ?
Empathy
Recognize that all our work is mental.
"Discuss it more openly. Drive discussion on education and away from stigma. More actively discuss treatment. Improve benefits in this space. Ensure insurance improves its policies and pay,ents to providers. "
Companies should cover mental health issues and disorders on health coverage and create campaigns to encourage people to get treatment or openly talk about those 
"talk about it more.  physical health is always front & center w/ ""wellness"" programs"
Assurance from companies that anonymity and full support will be guaranteed 
Need hospitality and humanity
Start caring and promote mental health care
Care only about individual performance 
I have no idea.
"More openness and awareness of health benefits (insurance, wellness programs, etc)"
idk
"Stop putting an emphasis on the glory of overwork, classify mental health and physical health in the same type of leave reason. Also it's important to have a culture where you're not required to explain why you need leave."
2
Need improvments
Continue challenging stereotypes around mental health
Often emphasis is on results only. If anything is in the way of that people are pushed out.
Development of more support groups. I feel that this would give employees a stronger support system when they're having trouble coping with their mental health disorder/issue.
"Don't wait for an employee to bring up a problem. Be proactive about mental health for all employees. Bring in experts for periodic check ups and screenings for anxiety, depression, etc. Learn about and teach non-violent communication and expect team members to use those tools at all times. Do not reward overworking."
Recognize the existence of mental health issues and provide proactive support 
Openly discuss the issues.
I doubt there is anything that could be done that would let me trust industry or employers
"First: acknowledge it, and that it affects us. The hero-worker-culture is toxic. "
Reducing workplace toxicity (esp. ableism)
Be more open about it
"Say openly that ""sick"" days can be used for any type of illness. Being too anxious, too stressed, too depressed to come to work or to do work COUNTS and is a valid and accepted reason to call off (and doesn't need to be disclosed. Saying ""I'm taking a sick day"" should be the only thing that's needed. Also, can we call them ""Wellness days""? You're not taking the day off to be sick, you're taking the day off to get well? "
Make it easier for managers to provide adjustments for those suffering 
"Emphasise work-life balance, de-emphasise the ""hero"" stories of working late."
Remove stigma and negative consequences of sharing that information
"Train manager to recognise early signs, change some aspects of the culture, like ""heroes working 24/7""."
Embrace awareness of common mental health issues like depression. Many folks don't understand it's just like any other health issue and may blame the person for poor performance
"I can’t only speak to my industry, so I have no idea if the tech industry is better or worse than most. But generally, I feel mental health to be very openly discussed and supported in the general community. I think it’s great that so many employers (mine included) actively help those with mental disorders. "
"First off, I think it's really hit-or-miss. Some places are probably great and everywhere else is probably terrible. I think it's like diversity in that everyone should take a course where they find out about a bunch of the possibilities and thus give everyone a baseline. Many people have no experiences and thus just have no idea and may not have an idea they have no idea."
Kill all rockstars (half kidding) (but only half).
"Acknowledge flexible working arrangements (remote working, flexible schedules) as a standard benefit, provide more explicit medical coverage for mental illness, remove stigmas, do not encourage crunch time/overwork as a heroic quality."
Give people room for own decisions and a digital quote in management
"Consistently use top-level descriptions like ""wellness"" or ""health"", emphasising that ""mental"" is a subset of ""physical"". Recognise that health issues are actually very common. Work with people to accommodate health issues."
Stress and effects are underrated
"more informations about things frequently encountered (depression, ptsd, etc.), infos about how to get help, formation for managers and like to better understand that. to be able to ""isolate"" and reduce stress/work on a worker and better confidentiality to talk about that."
More openness
Actually admitting that mental health affects life of employees badly. And not to think of them as a resource.
"A focus on sustainable work patterns, shorter days, and flexible schedules will benefit all employees, but will especially benefit employees with mental health issues"
Provide support (at all) and publicise it internally. 
Treat as normal as occasional cold / sickness
"As burnout is becoming a well known problem, It seems to me that now, thing are starting to change positively"
Consider mental health a part of overall physical health. They are not separate.
Awareness
Provide preventive doctor appointments like they do with chiropractic or accupunture as part of the medical plan
"Bigger organizations might be able to self-insure and provide better benefits. Smaller ones have to rely on health insurance programs. Overall, it's also hard to find good MH providers."
I don't know
"more communication - I would say basically the whole system is not ""human"" enough ; why would you expect the tek industry to be different ?"
"Openness about the issues, killing the start-up culture of overworking with fire"
hold it in the same regard as physical health. Don't discriminate against those with mental health. Encourage sharing of mental health status amongst teams. Don't fire people for not being mentally well
More resources and third-party expert help.
"It's getting better, but too much hinges on speed (to market, capital burn, etc...) to care that much about employee mental health, at least in SV startups. Outside the valley things are a little less frantic"
No view
"Like the rest of the US, the industry treats mental health like a joke. We're supposed to work 80 hours, down coffee and sleep pills, and not be ""brilliant jerks"" or ""lazy"". Man, it's almost like we shouldn't be exempt employees."
Educate and inform the workforce. Place the importance of mental health equal to physical health.
Encourage awareness and discourage stigma - this should come from upper management. This should be done by setting examples somehow - people need to see it happening. 
"Even when we have access to services, and even when we know we have that access, our industry and the companies I've worked for, don't make it clear that it's OK to talk about this stuff or ask for help and accommodation."
"We should encourage employees to have days to recover mentally when necessary, and to have manageable hours of work, 8 or less a day.

And discourage weekend working."
Remove the stigma
Continue to work to remove stigma. Create a safe place for workers to find and provide support. 
No questions asked health insurance coverage for mental health. No 10 day limit on PTO. Do not limit sick time to physical issues that warrant doctor's notes. 
"more awareness,more clear avenues of support, less stigma"
"I see an overall shift in the stigma surrounding mental health as lessening, but we still have a long way to go. Openly discussing and making others aware of mental health issues have helped tremendously."
"The stigma is pervasive/societal, but encouraging self-care and taking time off might help those who are struggling."
"acknowledging there are many people drawn to tech for many reasons, some of them include mental and physical health reasons. knowing there are friends, coworkers, and superiors who might struggle can humanize the issues."
Talk about it.
"It is frequently discussed that engineers are a ""certain type"".  From that perspective I think more prevalence of mental health resources when discussing health plans would make a lot of difference."
Talk about it. Treat it like any other form of illness or disability. Encourage open discussions or support groups. Give as much exposure to mental health issues that are covered by benefits as you would to any other disability or sickness.
I don't know
"I'm seeing a trend in the right direction of open conversation about it, but only in small pockets of the industry. It needs to be normalized more widely. The biggest challenge is the stigma. Even places that offer mental health care as a benefit don't do a great job of communicating it because it seems to be a taboo subject."
Continue working to destigmatize it.
"Make it easier to find out benefits related info (like  copays that apply to MH visits, etc.) or make a central resource of ""Here are some great mental health locations folks have recommended in the past if you're thinking of looking."""
Eliminate bro culture. Become more accepting of all people
Destigmatize discussing and getting therapy and other treatment. Allow people time off for mental health just like for physical health. 
"Be much more open, provide proper policies to discuss procedure and how the company can help"
"I think there are lots of people in tech who could use assistance, but who don't get it."
"create psychologically safe workspaces for all. Not just talk about it, but build that into the culture. Tech is a very macho industry, focused on appearing as strong as you can, while pouncing on the weaknesses of others.

If seen (not literal) urinating matches, where devs try to determine a pecking order of superiority and become the alpha male, who's word is to be taken as gospel; whatever they say is best practice, not because it's based on some real authority, but because they said so."
Talk about it more often.
"Act like it's real, common and treatable. Support mental health like any other supported employee issue (physical health, family leave, bereavement, etc.)"
Let them know about the support.
"Awareness, kill the stigma, a chemical balance in the brain is just as physical as a broken finger"
I think there could just be more of a focus on providing breaks (whether vacations or just time away from the desk/ work) that would alleviate a lot of strain.
Talk about it more. Be more open and direct.
just read reddit. Compassion? .... QED
"accomodation for folk with ADHD, which i know there a ton.  we're not lazy, we want to get things done.  sometimes we just can't"
Talk about it more so as to be open about it
"I think no employers do very well in this area, as America as a whole is terrible at the acceptance of mental illness as a disease and treating people with it with compassion."
I think there is always room for improvement. I don't really think it's specific to the tech industry either. We just need to get rid of the stigma surrounding mental issues.
"Encourage employees to have non-work time - so much of the industry is focused on ""working when you're not at work"" either on assignments or side projects in order to get anywhere, and it's incredibly counterproductive to mental health."
Avoiding heavy workloads and providing paid time off to spend treating or recovering from mental health issues.
"Stop advocating late-hour work and meeting impossible deadlines as the cool thing to do. Openly admit to feelings of anxiety or frustration or depression, especially from people in leading roles. Look for ways to maximise ""effective work"" rather than ""8 hours a day"". Allow (and applaud) taking a break if things are not working. Allow (and applaud) taking care of not work-related issues if they are worrying."
Talk about it openly and make it known that you can seek treatment without fear of stigma or other negative repercussions. Discipline for those who speak badly of colleagues with mental illness. 
"Understand that we're a lot of (mostly) very intense perfectionists who are working under stressful circumstances, and incorporate workplace perks to minimize resulting burnout, depression, anxiety, etc. "
I think it's not so much the tech industry as a whole as it is the type of company and their values.  I've worked for companies where you are expected to leave your problems outside the door of the office.  I've worked for companies who want their employees to bring their whole selves to work.  To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.  
"Boundary setting from the executive level up as far as working hours. Offering job ""perks"" that aren't just the MINIMAL legal requirements but aspects that actually improve and instigate better self care (whether that be resources to access or actual stipends to be able to access those resources in practice). Setting reasonable expectations as far as communication and culture. Diversifying your employee base."
"Flexible hours, better work planning, more focus on support services for the work"
More emphasis on the importance of positive mental health and less stigmatization.
Respecting work/life balance would be a big first step. Past that making programmes & funds available to people. 
I can not speak for an entire industry.
I think the tech *community* is at least more aware of it than other industries with which I am familiar.
"Call out health benefits and treatment options as a part of the benefits package during onboarding, and repeat this option throughout the year (how can employees take advantage of a benefit that's never discussed?). We should discuss mental health in the same straightforward way we discuss physical health. Talk openly about how mental health, stress reduction, and work life balance are a priority for the company, and then follow through with action. Provide multiple healthcare plans so that employees with mental health issues can choose the plan that's right for them--for instance, a low to middle income employee with a high deductible healthcare plan might find seeing a therapist to be a financial burden if they have not yet hit their deductible, thereby preventing them from going to therapy at all."
"Offer scheduled group discussion on the matter, with options to share personal experience."
I'd like to see more open discussion about the relationship between intellectually/emotionally heavy work (as that in the tech industry often is) and mental health.
"I'm not sure, just keep providing benefits and making accommodations for people."
"Get rid of this stupid stigma attached to it. My company is fantastic for NOT having this, and being very supportive about positive mental health, but I know other employers are not. Also, make getting help more transparent. Even though my employer always talks about taking mental health days, if I wanted to go to talk to a doctor, I wouldn't even know if it was covered."
Opened and support when people are suffering. To accept mental illness as a part of everyday life
Perhaps there should be some sort of training or education around mental health and diversity and acceptance.
More time off with less explanations.  EAPs.  Flexible schedules and work location.
"I think that for recurring services (like mental health providers, appointments, prescriptions, etc.) High Deductible plans penalize those who need those services at the beginning of the plan year. As employers seek to reduce health insurance plan costs, and as more and more employers only offer HDHPs, they should consider the option of front-loading employee's HSA/HRA plans or wellness incentives so that employees with mental health issues don't have to go through the choice of poverty vs Health while they try to meet their deductible, or the humiliation of asking for a pay advance so they can cover their bills."
require everyone to have a therapist
"I hope that other companies are doing things like mine - allowing flexible work from home schedules, providing ""quiet rooms"", trying to be as inclusive and non-judgemental as possible. "
"I think we talk a big game of being supportive of mental health, but we lack the follow through. It's great to offer PTO, but it's not great to create an environment where you're looked down on for taking PTO. Similarly, it's not great to create deadlines that put unnecessary levels of stress on people, and then repeating it over and over again without allowing time for recovery. I've seen both of these happen."
More awareness/support
"Make it approachable, it's not just something for IT, but in general. For a lot of people with mental health issues it's already difficult to talk about it, so there should be a safe environment where people can talk about it."
1
We need to increase awareness of mental illnesses and work at getting rid of the stigma surrounding discussing them.
Be more understanding and empathetic towards the complications of having one.  
Offer assurances that people could get help and possibly even be hired without being discriminated against because of any mental health issues.
"When someone is suffereing from a mental illness, their performance my suffer. If an employer is unaware of the issue, they may assume the employee is lazy or looking for another job. Employers need to reach out and be empathetic. Assume the employee is not performing well for a reason. And offer to help. "
"Raise awareness, be open, support affected"
"Better health care coverage, providing alternate work arrangements, not treating others as strange for having mental issues "
Not demand perfection of employees.
"Keep schedules flexible to roll with the punches the employee might be going through on any given day. Encourage open communication on both sides. Full medical benefits, including therapy. Also, an Employee Assistance Program for employees to call when in crisis to have someone to call and talk to and get a rapid referral for 8 therapy sessions (EAPs do a lot of other awesome things too!) FSAs, so employees can afford medication and treatment at a pre-tax rate."
"I think we do OK. That said, I think we're demographically predisposed to people with mental health issues. Who else is attracted to a field of very intelligent semi-solitary misfits working marathon hours?"
Mental health first aid training. Talking about it openly.
"Oh gosh, that's a huge question. Mainly be kind and patient and provide support options."
"Train line managers to handle it, and have guidelines for things that would help. Also more mental health first aiders and mental health sick days. Also therapy should be included in health benefits"
not sure
Provide additional resources and avenues for accessing mental health support outside of the employee hierarchy (eg without going through a superior)
"awareness of the normalcy of it, and more options for getting help"
Break the stigma around mental health
"you have to reverse the stigma, let people know their jobs aren't at risk"
dont know
"discuss options in healthcare plans, more discussion about services, offer free counseling services."
"I think that there is a lot of drinking in the tech sector, which leads me to believe that there is a lot of undiagnosed mental health problems. Many tech companies encourage alcohol consumption by hosting happy hours or having alcohol available for employees on site. This makes it hard for people who have problems with alcohol to either abstain from alcohol, or speak openly about their struggles with it. Additionally, the normalization of excess alcohol consumption can lead to mental health problems themselves (e.g. Depression and anxiety). "
being more open about privacy and clear about policy
"It varies wildly by company.  I've had really good experiences, but I know at least one friend who works in a different part of the industry who has struggled.  Like anything, it depends on the business and specific managers."
Allow more flexible working hours. Stop focusing on working too much overtime as a proxy for productivity. Treat mental health issues as physical health issues (and handle both better!).
More open communication about the issue.
Avoid a culture of relentless pressure
Show examples or successful people who have been open and not stigmatized 
Awareness. Especially in small shops or startups. 
Talk more! But respect privacy too 
"Accept that we're all actually humans and that's ok. Don't frame negative behavior (alcoholism, antisocial, work obsessed) as positive."
"Become more acceptable of it, such as explicitly allowing sick time for mental issues besides physical"
"Encourage conversations in the workplace about supporting ourselves and each other through challenging times. I think everyone experiences reactions to stress, pressure, grief, and troubling life events. If we have an open and friendly policy about staying home from work with a fever/illness, we should also be open and supporting about caring for mental health in similar ways."
4
I think it's still not talked about in a way that's supportive. Work culture needs to be more flexible to allow for things like appointments or just general flexible work time. 
Reassure people that there won't be negative consequences to talking about a mental health issue. Educate employees about how to handle colleagues' mental health issues sensitively
Be a lot more explicit on their processes and procedures. Be pro-active voices in the industry for good mental health support and help remove stigma
"Change culture of extremes, seek balance, flexibility"
"\- too much focus on individualism which leads to isolation
- include mental health issues in the reasons why someone might take a sick day/PTO
- acknowledge the broader social context and how it affects people; e.g. #metoo has had a big effect on a lot of women - both empowering but also re-traumatizing"
Having more people high in the management chain talk openly about their mental health issues without retaliation 
"The majority of the tech industry only pays lip service to true work/life balance. They talk about how important work/life balance is but they only truly reward the workaholics resulting in the crazy 50-60 hour work weeks and crunch time stories we all hear about and experience. Tech companies are designed as engines to turn youthful ambition into money in the most efficient way possible ... by burning through people and only keeping the absolute strongest, luckiest, or most ruthless."
Normalize mental health issues and support for them.
"I think there is a great deal of pressure to work 60+ hours which leads to stress, anxiety and other mental health issues. Eliminating the pressure to work on vacation and take time to recharge and focus on personal care is important. "
Create an environment where it's OK to talk about it and get help without the fear of judgement and negetive impact of possible work/promotion opportunities
"Stop being such fucking assholes, learn something about the topic, stop othering people, get some therapy, and learn to actual appreciate diversity instead of just talking about it."
"Discuss mental health coverage in health-care benefits, discourage overworking, encourage people to take PTO and other time away from their desks, etc."
Previous employer had a psychologist come in once a week and any member of staff could privately book a session. More initiatives like that would be good
"Reduce stigma, stop glorifying overwork, treat mental health like physical health, focus on long-term employee outcomes, value employee well-being in and of itself."
Better awareness culture-wise. Admins letting employees know about options for treatment/time off
More understanding.
Follow the principles of compassionate coding. Stop promoting psychopaths. Treat gaslighting and mental torture the same as we treat sexual harassment.
Mental health is not separate from physical health.  Removing that stigma would improve access and acceptance.
"I'm not sure -- at a certain point it seems like it's an unfair burden to the employer. There is a limit, I think, of what you should expect others to do for you."
"Raise more awareness, create an environment where openness and respect is celebrated. "
Talk about it more.
More pressure on employers to offer support and guidelines for employees
Increase awareness for support.
Boss should talk openly about the benefits of mental and physical health.
Talk about it more. Offer wellness services. Remove the stigma.
Talk about it. Make sure folks know their options. Be open about struggles you've had/been through.
"Make a pointed example that everyone has mental health issues, and to treat it as less of a stigma."
improve the openness and acceptance of those with mental health and physical health issues
idk
Encourage employees to have regular mental checkups just as they would physical ones. Broadcast what mental health benefits the company provides and encourage them to use them. 
More awareness that mental health issues are very common in tech
"I think everything we've done, mental awareness wise, has been led by one awesome employee and the company facilitates it but they don't do a lot on their own. We are more open about it than other workplaces but it could be better if the company owned more of it"
I think we should all talk more openly about mental health.  That also requires that we have empathy for those that do talk about it.
"Ensure insurance provides coverage, be flexible with personal time"
?
I really don't know. Just acknowledge the elephant in the room and don't make it a problem but a way of leaving/working.
"Implement practices that would avoid the stigma of mental health disorders. We are all alittle crazy, right? "
Ensure that mental health services are available and covered by insurance.
A better focus on putting all employees into a position to succeed.  Would depend from person to person.  
Start talking about it
Encouraging more openness. Providing enough paid leave and time for things that aren't work.. having your whole life and identity wrapped up in work is damaging. 
OSMI should be have resources specific to UK industry :)
get rid of 40hr weeks
Remove the stigma of just talking about it
"Provide a lot of resources up front (upon hire) and then ongoing.  This would show that it was a priority and serve as a constant reminder (which matters, because you might not have a crisis when you're hired, and therefore might not seek out resources at that time, but could later on.)"
It seems that almost every dev I met had a burnout or depression. It would be nice if employers acknowledged it as a normal part of life and learn to just deal with it.
"Cut out the [achievement, bro, toxic masculine] culture. Acknowledge mental health as a normal thing that just happens."
In general I think most of the tech industry places work ahead of personal health and contributes to mental health disorders
"Employers should provide mental health benefits, clear guidelines around how they'll support someone suffering with mental health issues, awareness of mental health issues, training for managers / leaders so they are aware of the signs of mental health issues (burnout, for example), and show an acceptance of those dealing with mental health issues."
Mental health care should be standard in benefits. Flexibility in schedule and responsibilities should be available when necessary.
"First, acknowledge it exists. Second, educate people so they understand that a person is not a disorder. Those first two steps alone could take a really long time."
"I think the tech industry is better than many other industries at highlighting the importance of mental health, but there's definitely room for improvement. Also, I have an unfounded feeling that given the types of people attracted to the industry, there's a higher-than-average incidence of mental health issues, which means that the tech industry needs to be leading the pack when it comes to informing about mental health issues and caring for employees with mental health issues."
"I don't think is an issue from the tech industry in general, but mental health issue is still not fully viewed as a health issue. This can be easily represented as the number of times that your plan covers your appointments with a therapist. I haven't ever seen a plan that would cover you indefinitely, most of them cover 10 sessions in a year. Because the mental health is a lot more common on the tech industry it would be necessary for this industry, especially really big corps which are viewed as role examples, to push for a more significant change on that aspect."
Make it OK to talk about.
Employers need to be aware of mental health issues and how common they are. They also need to create an environment where those issues can be disclosed without worry of losing one's job.
Don't expect excessive effort as the baseline
They want to be well intent to keep their employes
I think the industry learned that mental health should be taken more and more seriously. Maybe be more explicit about it and explain when check mental issues with a specialist.
"Continue to advocate for proper handling of individuals with mental health issues, allow for more leniency in regards to working from home, removing distinction between PTO (sick, vacation, personal, etc) so as to allow for more mental health days if needed, continue to educate employees on how to utilize their provided health insurance plan effectively to diagnose and treat mental health issues, and provide resources to employees to seek help for themselves and others in situations where none of the above would otherwise be applicable. "
Just talk to each other
"More open discussion, more time flexibility, less hectic work schedules"
Make it clear that there are options available.
"Talk about potential mental health stressors typical of tech work, have options for evaluation and coverage made clear early in a new role."
Industry thinks that the brain is something that a person can control.
Openness about options and financial support. 
"On an individual/peer level, I think there's some awareness that a lot of us have ""social"" issues that are sometimes related to mental health disorders/issues. It seems like that would give people in our industry at least a step up in handling the conversation. My experience seems to reflect that. On a more institutional level, I'm not sure of a best course that would fit all. In my personal experience, efforts toward supportive conversation and connection to relevant resources were lacking from management, so that's a good place to start. "
"Prevent burnout. Seriously reprimand or give negative reputations to companies that allow burnout and have burnout as part of the culture. Burnout as part of company culture looks like working longer than 8 hours a day; having PagerDuty go off in the middle of the night for someone who isn't on-call; not allowing employees to unplug during vacation. Ways to prevent burnout: Allow employees to unplug when not working (nights, weekend).

Never let it get to the point that an employee commits suicide due to working conditions."
"many companies have a culture of output with little to no compassion for the mental health of their employees, which is ironic because our mental facilities are the only tool we have to create output"
Less emphasis on long hours
"Educating team members to understand how and why people act when they are affected by a mental health issue. And to let them know their capabilities for caring for themselves and what will be supported. (i.e. working from home, taking leave, flexing time, etc.)"
"Better coverage, allow remote work no questions asked. "
"More benefits, more acceptance.  "
Just bringing it up ever
"Be a bit more active in their support. I think most places would work something out, bit nothing is prepared in advance."
Not sure
"Mental health is not widely acknowledged as an issue worthy of accommodation without documentation. One cannot have a mental health day as easily as one may have a sick day for a cold, etc."
Weekly counseling. Motivational speech. Family get together with office colleagues.
"I think raising awareness and showing employers that mental health issues are REAL, but also showing examples of successful employees who have mental health issues."
More open communication about it.
Talk about it more. Emphasize mental health the same as physical health (we get checked for tobacco use & have an onsite clinic - nothing similar or even a meditation room onsite)
"Awareness, sick days ok for mental health "
Improve visibility
TALK ABOUT IT. Learn to talk about mental health and about how we feel and how we experience the world.
"Mention it as a thing that exists without blame or shame. Publicize the resources available, like employee assistance plans. "
Try to remove the stigms around discussing such things and seeking help.
Its talked about and not shamed
Be supportive
"My belief based on managerial observations is that the tech industry involves intensive thinking, so anyone you has mental health issues in one area of their life are unfit in other areas (i.e. employment)."
"As I see it being talked about at conferences, I think the more we can educate others about mental health issues and how to be supportive, the better and more supportive we can be."
De-stigmatize mental health concerns
Stop focusing on Rockstars and making it impossible to take time off
Be more educated that mental health issues are common and do not make a person less capable of being productive contributors to the company's success.  Be flexible and understanding when employees need accommodations to maintain good mental health.
Encourage mental health first aid training in additional to physical first aid
"Openness, resources, concessions, flexibility when mental health issues affect work."
openness could be better.
"Since the industry is male dominated, there should be more talk to increase awareness and reduce stigma.  Offering peer support programs and role models would also help make the discussion ok"
"it's a comfort thing at this point imo, needs to be talked about so it doesn't feel weird to bring up issues"
"If it is mentioned at all, it's during a meeting to go over benefits. The same was true with welness programs at all of my employers. It could be greatly improved by socializing the availability of benefits and resources throughout the year--especially around holidays when lots of folks struggle."
3
"They should show that normal people (engineers, accountants, secretaries, not executive) have mental health problem, are receiving non-invasive help and are functioning or getting better. But I would not accept to be the one to be shown. Isn't it ironic?"
Talk about it
"Model it, talk about it. "
"We need a safe space to discuss it, we cannot be afraid of openly talk about. We are only allowed to talk about mental health to psychologists and psychiatrists, even discussing it with family is not as open as it should be."
Stop encouraging 'crunch' mentality & incentivising extreme overtime & neglect of vacation time.
"Make sure that talking openly about it has no negative effect on the work, applications and the likes. "
"Discuss issues more openly. Allow for more modified work environments (work from home, etc.)"
"It seems to me, after 28-years in the IT field, that there is a much more open and honest dialogue about mental issues, perhaps due to the predilection of many with anxiety, mild functional autism, or Asperger's to gravitate to the field.

In other fields, these types of mental disorders are typically seen as weaknesses.  In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.  The tech industry should show that some of these issues can actually be pulled on as a source of strength, both as the direct result of the issue (say, hyper-focus perhaps) or through the strength of character that is cultivated in learning to overcome these issues/challenges.  "
"Discuss mental health as frequently and openly as physical health, and explicitly call out things like ""taking a mental health day"" as a perfectly valid and encouraged reason for using sick time."
Provide mental health days and wellness programs. Remove any lingering stigma around mental health by having influencers be open about their struggles.
in office therapists?
I think the biggest step would be to recognize that demanding long hours and constantly high levels of performance from people is not sustainable. I also think more could be done to be supportive to people experiencing issues and more education in the tech industry on the significance of mental health issues would be great. 
Talk about it more openly during new hire onboarding and annual benefits selection — some signs to be aware of and resources available.
Conduct some family events occasionally.
"I think they could provide more support with helping guide employees with mental health issues toward blending in with the rest of the workforce instead of treating us like we are crippled or inferior to those who don't identify as having these issues, and generally provide more support and guidance as well as not discriminating in their hiring practices at the start. "
Maybe/Not sure
Open 1 on 1 communication with employees. Better benefits disclosure.
They do poorly the field is wide open for improvement
Be more open. Actually care. 
Tech industry seems to offer a lot of benefits such as health plans as incentives to join however the type of work involved is demanding which may have a negative affect on mental halth 
instead of pushing people to their limit that should focus on reasonable goals and timetables to reach them
Better support for mental health care providers. If insurance paid for ongoing mental health care more consistently.
EDUCATION
"I consider myself lucky in my current job position. I co-founded the project, I have been there from the beginning. The company is still small and I am essential yet. The relationship I have with my co-workers is really close. The human side of all of us is strong. All these things make it possible to be understanding with my personal situation. If I were in another more ""traditional company"" is possible that they are less compassionate with me.
"
Its not often talked about even though most developers show symptoms
Reduce competitive pressure with coworkers. Encourage cooperation.
No.
Pay for treatment.  Offer in-workplace counceling
awareness. access to resources and education on the subject. in house therapy. 
Reign in overtime and better handle project timelines. I feel most tech workers are way overworked and there's always pressure to get more things done in less time.
Begin to explain through open discussions the nuance behind the diverse variety of potential issues. Create systems to facilitate those with mental health constraints to function similarly within the same domain as those without.
"create awareness programs, provide help and support"
"I think clearer boundaries need to be set so that employees recognize that their mental health, like their physical health, is their own responsibility. Employers can assist folks with resources, but employees are accountable for accessing those resources to keep themselves healthy enough to perform their job functions. If these resources aren't enough, then employees need to feel comfortable moving on to more accommodating arrangements for themselves. Employers aren't medical care givers, as an employee I would not want them to be, and employment arrangements must be mutually beneficial."
drive employees less hard in the first place
"Understanding and acceptance. Like a physical aliment it isn't going to go away once you understand it, it's going to take time to heal. "
Coverage for mental health treatment.
Talking in a way that affirms that some employees may have these issues.
discuss mental health support with all new employees
Companies should be more explicit about the mental health resources that are offered.
Allow people time off to get the help they need... no questions asked
"Take the same amount of positivity and anonymity zeal when proactively asking employees to report potential ethics violations, and do the same for potential mental health needs."
I think the industry should be more vocal about these issues. Companies should let employees know what resources are there and that they will help and accept them. I have never heard a company mention mental health as a concern before.
Create more processes and make more clear what obligations an worker has with the company.
Na
"We're getting there, but still too much focus is placed solely on burn-out, and breakdowns still build up with alarming regularity. "
"I just hope we make it more acceptable to talk about mental health. Let's all download Stop, Breathe, Think on Slack and meditate together."
Ban the crazy culture of working non-stop 365 days a year! Breaks should be encouraged and a healthy balance of work and rest should be the default expectation in all workplaces. 
"They could identify specific issues and problems that IT workers are likely to encounter in their positions. As the job market begins to incorporate tele-commuting and alternative workplace environments, issues can arise. Employee should be supported and provided with resources to help them adjust."
"I feel it offers greater support than other industries as it has a strong focus on work-family-conflict and out of work demands, great number of tech-related health efforts and support"
Stop treating employees as disposable brains.
Treat mental illness as any other disease or medical condition.
"Stop interview processes such as whiteboarding, live coding, etc. These cause a lot of impostor syndrome in candidates and cause many of them to beat themselves up after a bad interview."
"Industry: Actively work to replace the stereotype of a developer - you know the one, the stereotype is that a programmer doesn't need sleep, can live off of Soylent or Doritos and Mountain Dew, can execute bug-free code for like days on end without getting up from their desk - with one that is more humane. Programmers are people, jeesh.  Employers:  Don't be assholes."
More awareness!
"Awareness of how IT work affects mental health, awareness of resources, destigmatize, community"
More open discussion and treatment options.
Employers of small- and medium-size companies don't pay ANY attention to employee's health. The only thing that matters is making the money.
More exposure and info sessions about it would help.
No idea
"discourage constant use of computers and social media, encourage normal work hours, firm protection policies for leave and mental health issues, full health coverage for all types of health issues. "
Create awareness about mental health
"Encourage more open discussion to remove stigma, encourage team members to think of mental health issues as similar to physical health issues."
Better consideration of the purpose of work. More confidence to employees. Leave behind traditional practices that consider presence at work (doing you hours) more important as the actual work done.
"Give more information, treat people kindly and with respect, and be open to discussing about mental illness"
Take steps to reduce burn-out. Be more open about mental health for everyone.
N/a 
As someone who has not suffered from mental health issues I'm not really qualified here.
Even though my experiences are limited I'd say that the tech industry as a whole is more aware of mental health issues than most fields.
I think it's a taboo topic in every industry and it's normal to take days off on a physical issue but not mental
Generally continuing to talk about it
"Benefits are often provided and support lines provided but it usually is the extent of what they will do. Often in discussing openly, people approach you differently and often not in a good way."
allow remote and flexible work to accommodate appointments
Increase services and awareness 
"I think the first step is acknowledging mental health as a priority in the tech community. In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. "
Get rid of open floorplans
More emphasis on things like meditation and other techniques to increase happiness
Raise awareness - mental health is mostly like physical health. Diabetes and Depression are both caused by the inability of an organ to regulate chemical balances in the body.
Encourage people to look after themselves before an issue
Be open about mental health services and provide similar perks to the physical health perks many are providing and talking about
Be clear that we are humans and that feelings (good and bad) are part of our lives and jobs
"Keep in mind that too much work is no good, do meditation and breath sessions during the working hours"
I think big corporations do a better job than small companies or startups
"They can create an amusement center for the employees. they should provide a proper time of leisure for the employment. The employee should give enough time to their family. And the most important thing is that, every employee have to be given safe environment of job security and freedom as much as it can be able."
Stop putting white men in charge. Provide positive support for individuals who self-identify.
Make sure that mental health options are clearly outlined in employee benefits literature.  Provide employees a safe place to talk if need be like an EAP.  Provide quiet rooms and personal spaces to find time to relax.
I don't have a mental health issue so I am unsure. 
Manager training to understand mental illness and how to respond in at least a non-toxic way. Understanding for work accomdations (i.e. WFH).
realize when treated a person will provide good work and when it isnt treated the company will spend more money on sick time and ok work
We could talk about it. We could stop having businesses that have crunch times. We could make it easier for folks to know what mental health options are available. We could stop stigmatising mental health as a society.
"Meaningful support, at a minimum, in the form of acknowledging mental health and encouraging a non-stigmatized attitude toward mental health issues."
Normalize it. Encourage healthy work/life balance. Discourage hero culture.
"More outreach, more understanding of limitations (too many job adverts that list going above and beyond/being a ""rockstar"" etc. which is inaccessible to people who need time to decompress and need periods of less stress between projects). More openness in general."
Evaluate team performance instead of individuals.
2
"Actively talk about it as just a normal part, similar to (physical) wellness programs"
"I have seen it become a more openly discussed issue; not just through OSMI, but other people that I know both personally and as public personas discuss how the tech industry handles mental health issues."
Continue to reduce stigma. Particularly bad amongst older developers where there’s a cultural difference. 
Stop expecting everyone to work free overtime! I hate that it's an expectation that you code all but 24/7. That's not good for my mental OR physical health.
I think all companies would benefit from the work OSMI does. I think having an open focus on mental health on the same level as physical health in the organization would be beneficial. 
"One thing that bothers me is that a lot of companies seem to think that being a ""lifestyle"" company means putting up a bar at work. "
"Try to make sure that people are aware that mental disorders are NOT caused by someone being ""weak"" or ""undisciplined"", but that it's often times due to a physical issue (i.e. brain doesn't have as many receptors or has too many receptors for a certain type of chemical, etc)."
OSMI helps opens eyes of those who do not suffer mental illness
"The tech industry is filled with trolls and fiends who like to feast on people's emotional state. Its a highly competitive field and people actively use this against other, for instance a socially inert chat group on StackOverflow - filled with people some of which are not very good talking to people openly and suffer from severe pitfalls gets targeted on twitter for days. Why? Because they were a little rude to someone who wasn't trying to participate in the chat actively. The person who tweets gets glorified but as a result this safe-place gets destroyed."
We should talk about mental health as much as we do physical health. We tell people not to come in if they're sick but no one talks about mental health days.
"prioritize wellness and balance, provide early intervention without judgement- mental/emotional  first aid and positive preventative care"
"I'm not entirely sure. I think the tech industry might be one of the more accepting industries, but there's still a pretty big stigma attached to mental health issues."
I don’t know. I don’t feel qualified to answer. 
therapy should be covered by health insurance benefits
There is a lot of pressure to perform and accomplish a lot of work quickly.  More open acknowledgement of how common mental health issues are and how high pressure situation can create mental health issues would hopefully destigmatize them.
"I think slowly restoring the ""self-care"" time of employees is a big first step. Having the ability to disconnect from being responsible 24/7 for the health and wellbeing of a computer service is important. And not just on scheduled vacation times, but regularly and generally as a rule. 

The best thing I've gotten is being in a results-based work flow. I'm not required to be at work at a time, but to get work done. This allows me to have my own Self-Care moments or days without worrying about not being ""there"" for work."
The industry is very focused on productivity to the point that anything that takes away from it is hidden.
 
Be proactive and open about it. Actively talk about it in the workplace and normalize these things instead of waiting for incidents to happen. Change the mindsets and promote an open culture.
Keep trying to eliminate the stigma of it.
There should be a greater understanding of how our work is affected by mental health issues. Employers should know that everyone has a health issue of some sort (or will occasionally) and it's not something that should carry a stigma.
"Talk about it more, encourage working fewer hours, taking longer breaks, better work/life balance"
"Keep talking about it and breaking down the stigma. Outright offer ""mental health days"" or make it clear that ""sick days"" can and should be used to deal with mental illness, exhaustion, stress, etc. Stop treating it as different from a physical illness."
They don't care about your mental or physical health. They just want deliveries and there is never a break. The inefficiencies caused by mismanagement come down to the dev/qa teams to make up that time. They expect factory work and treat you are replaceable if you don't keep churning out code.  
"Less stigma, more open discussion."
less of a stigma
Acknowledge that MH issues are real and have a profound impact on tech workers who use their brains to work. Depression has blunted my memory to the point where I don't remember simple things (I have any number of Stack Overflow bookmarks). The treatments are often as bad as the diseases. My antianxiety medication makes me fuzzy and apathetic. My friend who had ECT suffered *severe* memory loss and was unable to do her job for several weeks even after she was medically discharged.
Normalize treatment and suffering. Let people have space to deal with issues and do their best work. 
it is more socially understood and acceptable in the tech / younger environment
2
"Become more involved in the acknowledgement and support of these issues.  Training of leadership to know how to deal with different issues and even use them to the employee's advantage when possible is important.

And yes:  I do believe you can use things to an employee's advantage/advancement (such as hyper-focus)."
"I think that the tech industry overworks employees, and because of the intellect required to do some of this knowledge work, they assume that mental health issues are in direct opposition to that work. People work long hours without much consideration for their well being."
Discuss mental health more openly.
"Be more open about it, first and foremost. The technology field is super emotionally disconnected. Which is interesting, because I imagine there's a fair amount of autism genetics floating around in the field—which are known for less emotional response. More talks at conferences, more awareness campaigns and things of this nature will help a lot with the emotional wellness of the industry and, since the industry has such an impact on modern life, the emotional wellness of a lot of walks of life. "
"High stress cultures and burnout can exacerbate mental health symptoms in those prone to them. Treating employees like people, not machines, helps. Flexibility and open mindedness help.

As tech has become more mainstream, tech jobs have become less friendly to people with quirks and eccentricities."
Magically make everyone more empathetic
Offer more mental health care and make sure employees are okay.
I haven't worked anywhere with good management that could improve on this specific issue.
"Be more flexible with time-off, be more open to talking about it."
"I think a lot of the tech industry pushes people towards burnout by encouraging people to be constantly working, both at work and outside of work. There's a general idea that making things at work isn't enough, that your job should also be your hobby outside of work. I think this is unhealthy and people should have different outlets and interests they're pursing in their free time. We don't expect people who do sales to be selling outside of work, why expect people who code for a living to also be coding outside of work?"
"For my issue, all that I want is privacy, and I feel that every employer for which I've worked meets that requirement."
Provide free professional services
Better support/training for people so that everybody isn't expected to perform at 1000% 24/7 in a way that is particularly unsustainable with mental health issues.
more resources. especially as a large amount work from home
Not sure. This is a problem with broader societal forces in my opinion.
"Stop glorifying high-anxiety positions and portraying ""crunch-time"" as an industry norm. Alternately, make it possible to search for jobs that are sensitive/understanding around mental health concerns and don't raise anxiety as a standard management technique."
"Work towards removing the stigma and focus on mental/emotiona/physical health. Often the industry values you as a productive worker, not a complete, holistic, and healthy individual."
I'm not sure there is a solution in a context where profits dictate decision making - ie capitalism.
1
State explicit support for taking sick days for mental health issues. State explicit support for employees who are dealing with mental health issues and say that they are just as important as physical health issues. Offer health insurance plans that subsidize or cover mental health. Be more aware of addiction/alcoholism recovery and be more sensitive/sensible with work events.
"Talk about it early and often, as part of company meetings, normalize conversations around mental health. Describe the process end to end what it would look like to ask for help."
2
Normalizing more healthy work habits. Too many employers talk positively about mental health but still promote unhealthy work hours and habits
Promote mental health more and allow employees to take mental health days. Allow much more PTO or a generous work from home policy. Let people step away from the stresses of work more frequently to improve their mental health.
"For starters, be aware of what mental health entails/encompasses. Learn how it is that an employer can help, or support someone with mental health issues. Finally, be understanding/endorsing of ""mental health days"". My brain is my toolbox as a software engineer, sometimes I need a day just to polish the rust off."
"The industry encourages long hours, an unhealthy work/life balance, and perfection. Having time off and encouraging taking time off for employees would be a step in the right direction - it might lead to temporary losses (1 less person to work on a project), but would be beneficial for all parties involved in the long run."
"Tell employees what their plans cover for mental health. Cover psychotherapy session out of pocket costs when insurance does not fully cover. Getting the right therapist that’s also covered under insurance is almost impossible. Most of the times the good ones don’t accept insurance so I had to pay out of pocket, I used up most of my flexible spending account with this but if I didn’t have that I would have been in trouble."
"Talk about mental health. Abandon the ""startup"" ""all work, all the time"" mentality. Focus on building trusting relationships. Communicate. Integrate the whole person into the workplace, not just the professional front we often present."
Better education around what mental health looks like and how to know when you may need to seek additional help. Also better training around how to respond to someone's mental health condition.
More open discussions about mental health and how to support it in the workplace.
"No one speaks about mental health aside from encouraging yoga along with gym time. No one in my company speaks about mental health issues, in general."
"Focus more on work/life balance, people who overwork and the teams that encourage this, try to provide support for the whole person (physical, intellectual, mental, etc)"
"Understand employees/job candidates who have mental health problems and learn to work with their abilities. I feel like employers today are entirely focused on production, and if the person has problems that could affect their quantity of production, employers have no problem getting rid of them or not hiring them."
"More generous leave policies for employees dealing with mental health issues. Ability for employees to take leave to care for friends in crisis, not just family members. Many employees in the tech industry do not have families but still have close friends who need their support too."
"Some employers are really good about letting people know about the physical health benefits they get from insurance, but they neglect the mental health benefits. At a previous job (not tech related) there were services available for mental health that I didn't find out about until I had an anxiety attack at work. Had I known about the services that were available, I could have gotten the help I needed before my work performance was effected."
"Talk about it, destroy the stigma and give people resources to cope."
Would be nice to see more companies actively pushing employees to take time for themselves.
"I'm not sure how to judge the entire industry. I feel that some companies completely ignore it from a historical lack of admitting emotions in the work environment and others allow employees to take time off, work from home, have less structured days/offices to help. It is really split high/low."
"Better resources and training about how to support people with mental health issues, and how to comply with relevant laws. More emphasis on work-life balance and flexible scheduling/locations."
Stop treating it differently from any medical issue.
I work in the marketing department of a pretty supportive company.  I think toxic masculinity in so-called traditional engineering spaces could be really detremental to one's mental health. 
Talk about it more openly. Encourage a better work/life balance. Question more the culture too often in place (to stress about short term and never work on long term)
"The industry praises ""hustle"" culture, which pushes people to work over 40 hours a week & implies that those who do not work or learn over the standard 40 are lazy."
I think there is more of a focus on productivity and working hard and mental health takes 2nd place. Employers should be more open about mental health and educate and encourage their employees.
"Be more open about it, remove the stigma"
Encourage work / life balance. Make it clear that your employees are worth more than just what they can produce (happy teams deliver more anyways). Make people aware of options they can take if they need to lighten the load a bit (this applies even if you don't have a mood disorder bc any engineer can suffer burnout). Training for managers about needs of employees with mental health disorders.
I think the industry needs to treat people as individuals and accept that if they fill the different needs of their employees that would be reflected on their productivity.
"It would require Tech to get off of its elitist approach of hiring that openly removes the voices of those who arent ""go getters"". I am tired of the buzz words that this industry uses to validate its discrimination. ""culture fit"" ""not technical enough"" ""they cant move fast enough"" or any other vague hiring motif that allows people to substitute facts with personal bias. "
"Employers should make their mental health benefits as clear as their physical health benefits (eg. copays, treatment covered, etc). I haven't experienced it personally but I think a PTO MINIMUM is a great idea, to encourage people to take time off."
"Mostly, respect work/life boundaries more. 40 hours is a lot, reduce time overall or be OK with sprinting: 3# hours some weeks, 4# hours some weeks. Work medical leave into scheduling. Work sick days into scheduling. Encourage people to talk about how they navigate their tendencies in order to ease into discussions about navigating and mitigating disorders."
"I think managers talking about it would cause it to be more accepting for employees to talk about it. Overall, people need to talk more about mental health to make it more normalized."
"The trend of ""working as much as it takes"" is harmful to everyone's mental health, but even more so to those who already have mental health issues."
More openness would be good
"Stop encouraging people to live at work, stop encouraging people to work more than 40 hours a week, demonstrate what it actually means to have a supportive working environment for those with mental health problems, stop making us all work in open work spaces"
"I think more employers need to learn about mental health. More training, classes or tools on how to recognize symptoms, how to talk to employees and what their state/local health providers offer."
Actually talk about it and normalize it
"I think although strides have been made, there is still a giant stigma relating to mental health issues. All my giant company (currently) has done to my recollection is have meditation seminars."
Make it more of an out in the open issue that everyone suffers from and make policy to support everyone
"Improve the culture, and get rid of the toxic masculinity/sexism in the workplace."
"There needs to be more education. Tech work is extremely mentally taxing and in the same sense that athletes are more likely to sustain physical injuries, tech workers are more likely to sustain mental injuries. While we can strive to avoid this, I think it's an unavoidable part of the work.

Talking about this openly goes a long way to helping - but also providing at work support. Could you imagine if when a athlete was injured they had to outsource all support and treatment of that injury?

I understand not all employers have the resources to provide in house support groups, but these employers should be aware of community resources and be encouraging their employees to take advantage of the resources. Lead by example. Mentally healthy supervisors help foster mentally healthy employees."
Talk about it more and invest in employees well being
"Free counseling, available resources"
"prioritize things like work/life balance over constantly working (which is more difficult for people with health issues, physical or not), and accepting people with different lived experiences rather than expecting all to be the same"
"Tech is far too focused on end goals at all costs. Burn hard, burn fast, replace candle. The people are rarely seen as such."
"Recognize that coding for example takes a lot of creativity and a fresh, clear state of mind. Its not a matter of just putting in hours."
"Raise awareness of how common it is and normalize it as something easy to talk about. Enforce minimum time off policies and promote disconnecting from work to support a healthy work/life balance. Offer paid medical assistance and erp programs. If the office provides food, avoid unhealthy food that can exacerbate mental health  issues. Offer workplace seminars on how to recognize and talk about issues. Offer workspaces with natural light and privacy."
no
Acknowledging how stressful the industry is.  Making sure to speak about support for mental issues as openly as physical issues.  Encouraging people to do self-care activities.  Offering programs to help people lower stress.
have a company therapist or psychiatrist. 
"Having some information available and having a culture that isn’t always “we got work to do” (we do, but we are all humans too)"
I
"It's probably better than most industries, being filled with by and large more liberal and younger employees. But I'm sure it varies from company to company. "
"As good or better than other industries, but still not good enough."
"The industry as a whole needs to disallow toxic cultures from continuing in the workplace. They need to enforce required vacation/paid leave, allow anonymous reporting and feedback from all levels of workers, and finally, to hold management teams accountable for their team's mental health support. No one can take this on alone!"
"In general, full-time tech company employees have good benefits (especially at big companies) and good benefits usually include mental health care (at least in Washington and California where I've worked). But it's also my experience that people will speak at length about their exercise routines etc and will not be as open about self care or mental healthcare."
"There's still a massive stigma against those with mental health issues. Especially those that are viewed as being ""more"" disruptive to getting work done. It would be great to see that addresses within the industry itself. "
"Create policies that allow working from home and remotely more freely. Allow for very frequent doctor / therapist appointments and flexible schedules. Train managers on how to recognize that someone might be suffering from mental health issues, and give resources to share. Give some sort of empathy training for differences in mental health in the workplace. Reduce expectations that people will have ""side projects"", or be able to go home and keep working."
Enforce benefits and encourage a more healthy culture vs reasonable expectations of work/personal boundaries.
"Awareness. Unfortunately, the state of the art in mental health medicine itself is many, many decades behind physical.health. So it is hard to judge employers having a progressive approach when the medical institution is so backwards."
More awareness
Mandatory confidential psychological evaluations
"Build more awareness, promote mental health days, promote work life balance"
"Despite OSMI and Greggy B and everyone else pushing for it, it feels like mental health is still discussed in hushed tones in corners of our industry.  I don't feel comfortable talking about it in person, though I tweet about it often.  This needs t change."
"Better insurance for various therapists, support groups, better understanding of the shades of mental illness."
Accept that mental health is as normal and important as physical health.
"Frankly, I think the industry does a poor job of embracing diverse persons in general -- sure, there are some classes like sexual orientation that do not seem to matter in the industry, but there is a lot of -- maybe not hostility but cool indifference (which might be worse!) to classes that are different from the stereotypical computer science geek -- within that stereotype some mental health conditions like autism might be seen as perfectly acceptable, but something like depression that might call for a strict sleep schedule (no all-nighters for you!) will probably be viewed in a very negative light."
"Eliminate the stigma and be more upfront with wellness programs and benefits that may be helpful, without you needing to seek them out."
"Overvalues behaviors that lead to burnout, machoness, and anti-social behaviors"
"Medical issues, in some way or the other,  affect us all. Any employer should give due attention to the overall health of it's people. This should be part of the benefits scheme of every employer."
.
Conduct awareness related towards health and pump them to have a healthy life style with exercise and all.
"As an engineer, money does make a difference. But not as much as the work conditions. Toxic environments are in no way good for anyone. Team-building trips every few months could be one way to help improve the relationships each person has with their coworkers."
"they need to create a real human care culture, not just try to fulfill legal regulations"
"Awareness is a great start. It would be helpful to have some best practices for the *people* , especially those involved with being oncall and the PTSD like symptoms involved such is cringing when their or others phones ring, cringing when hearing key words like down, broken, severity, and others associated with a loss of service and the accompanying responses from users, customers, and management. I have seen some companies attempt to mitigate the effects by giving the employee(s) a day off at the end of the oncall rotation, or offering at least comp time for any off hour outages, but some standards like these being published so they can be referenced by other IT professionals would go a long way as a tool to those attempting to improve the situation from within their organizations."
work/life balance
"I think in general there is a don't ask don't tell attitude. Some will provide some benefit as a token, but I'm not sure they care deeply to help those who want help.  Perhaps if employers were required by law to provide this benefit some others would take advantage of it. I think the harder issue is helping people see that it's ok to accept help, and get treatment. No one would say you are weak for getting a broken leg treated, but some think those with mental disorders just need to get over it."
"Hard-stop on the long-hours bragging.  A company where people routinely work longer than 40 hours a week should be one with no employees, and employers should be ashamed to admit that they do that.  Job ads for ""we work so hard all the time all day and all night"" are a sign of company sickness."
"Be considerate in regards to an employee's mental health. Be willing to accommodate an employee's requests to enable them to succeed in their position. Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills."
"For the most part, if the tech industry treated underrepresented groups (people of color, lgbtq+, women) better, I  believe that treatment of mental health issues would be better as well.  As a cis white man, I  believe that  my mental health issues would be handled well and without question, but I do not  believe that would be the case for some of my co-workers."
"Often managers put unnecessary pressure on developers to provide estimates and to work overtime to hit deadlines. Often the deadlines aren't really even required.
They probably shouldn't do that."
Provide open support and resources.
"I think the industry should encourage discussion of mental health problems and other disabilities. I think the industry does an acceptable job (still, there's room for improvement) accommodating mental health issues but it is still socially stigmatized, so I don't feel comfortable utilizing available resources or speaking about my issues in professional settings"
Don’t know
"I think putting people in ""one size fits all"" environment to work in is suboptimal. Sure the 9-5 works for some people but as far as for me personally an employer is getting way less value out of me as an employee if I were to be forced to work that way - and most employers don't like suboptimal investments. 
I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. "
explicitly define sick/leave time policies as applying to diagnosed physical AND mental illness. 
"It should be okay, at any company, to say ""I am having a ton of anxiety today, I need to do X or Y to deal with this, will be offline."""
Talk about it at the same level and frequency as physical illnesses. 
It's a difficult topic. Get more people out there talking about their issues so everyone knows they're not alone.
Flexibility for days where work just isnt going to happen.
"Allow for mental health days, reasonable length of work day. Recognize that people don't work well when they're highly stressed or not able to take care of their needs because of overwork."
Have open discussions about mental health
We should be more actively support people with mental health issue.
No pressure from above. No Top-Down Bullshit. Listen more to developers what is possible to achieve. More professionals or previous developers and not assholes as managers.
"The industry need standards to prevent employees from developing mental heath issues, I believe that most of it can be prevented if it shows more consideration for the human condition. We are not machines, we need a sustainable work pace, we cannot be threatened all the time by unrealistic deadlines, a balance need to be found. "
"I am not sure what they can do differently. Mental health issues are not something I have personal experience with and cannot speak to the treatment and response of employers, and I would not want to speak out of turn when it comes to mental health issues of which I know very little about. "
"I would love to see more open embracement of people with criminal records relating to substance abuse. Substance abuse in America is at about the same level as it has been for decades now, but arrests and incarcerations for it are at an all time high."
Insurance and flex-time for doctor appointments.
"The industry in general seems to have a fetish for the manic portion of the bipolar cycle, while actively looking down upon the depressive portion of the cycle, or those ""normal"" mental health (aka 1x employees).  Not sure what the industry can actually do except stop being so macho about money and growth and productivity."
Anything. I don't think it's addressed at all.
"Stop working us so hard. Keep to the 40 hour work week. Plan resources so ""crunch time"" becomes an idea of the past."
Ease up stressful and high pressure environments.
Current tech interview practices (whiteboarding / live coding) are demoralizing and contribute to ones feelings of not being welcome in the industry.
"Treat mental illness just like any other illness. If someone was hit by a car and put in the hospital, the company would send flowers and allow the person to heal. The same should be allowed for someone going through very emotional trauma or mental illness."
"Actively work against the culture of over-doing it (late hours, caffeinate to keep going, etc.).  Encourage people to work on open source projects on company time so that they don't need do so on their own time.  No ""crunch time"" should ever last more than a week; if it does, it means management screwed up and it's their problem, not the developers'."
"Build more flexible scheduling to accommodate for intense periods of creativity, focus, and stress that dont conform to 9-5 mentality"
Be more openly supportive.
Talking about it without any sort of judgment or stigma would be helpful. The crunch heavy environment of the tech industry seems unhelpful for actually discussing things like this.
1
"Improve diversity and inclusion. Many of the people with mental health issues also have trauma from their identities. 

Make sure people have adequate vacation, growth possibilities/interests and that there aren't other employees who are harassing them or not contributing to work without consequence. Transparency and vulnerability has to come from leaders in order to have a diverse, psychologically safe tech culture. "
Just breaking the stigma. 
"Not fetishize the asocial, poorly behaved male coder stereotype "
Make mental healthcare coverage standard in insurance. Work to end stigma.

"Talk about it, ever. Stop hiring and supporting abusive ""geniuses"". Understand concepts like the psychological contract between employees and employers. Understand and actively support diversity and inclusion efforts. Check in on your under-represented and marginalized employees. Make sure they're making friends at work, they're comfortable in their work space, they know who they can talk to. "
Reduce the stigma - provide anonymity but make it clear that mental illness is an illness and seeking treatment is the right thing to do
Inclusive culture and environment in regards to mental health and not being ashamed or afraid of taking care of your mental health.
"Make mental health a priority, talk about mental health issues, allow time off for individuals who need it. "
"I think the industry is fairly passive in discussing and supporting mental health.  More could be done to actively reduce stigma, and provide support to those who may benefit."
More awareness and less stigma. Normalize people taking sick days/advocate for therapy even if you're not in a crisis situation
"It's not just tech industry, it's 99.9% of industries and the nation as a whole.  Hence, the tech industry would have to break new ground and lead if they were to improve MH support for employees. They should start with providing the same health benefits for MH as they do for Physical Health, but since even physical health benefits generally suck these days, that's not saying much.  Our health care system is grossly broken, compared to the rest of the world."
Accept the fact that mental health can fluctuate and don't look away
Easy access to support. Whether that's just some written material or the contact info for professional help that can respond quickly. 
"Minumum paid time off. More control over deadlines, work load, *manager training*."
Medical insurance 
"Everyone is dismissive of mental health and can't relate if gmthey don't have it, until they have it"
I don't know
"Basic understanding of different personalities doesn't seem to be present in the tech world, let alone mental health. Management need to be people managers, not just experts in their field. Managers need training and support. Workspaces need to support quiet and profligate work as well as collaboration"
Better health plans and more flexible work hours
"I think it's becoming more open, but has a ways to go"
I don’t think it’s an industry specific problem but a problem as a whole across the board.
"care more for employees, more social interactions "
"Treat it like a physical health issue, and not blame the victim. Help the employee get effective help from professionals. Find different roles that might be more appropriate without blame."
Offer the same amount of encouraging healthy behavior campaigns and peograms for mental health as they do physical health.
Employers need to share more resources on insurance coverage and becoming more tolerant of missing work on days that employees need to recharge. Taking one long vacation doesn't help.
Treating developers as humans as opposed to resources they don’t understand. 
The tech industry needs to understand that mental health is as important as physical health and that mental health and physical health affect people all over the industry
no
Acknowledge its existence 
"Be more open, understand how to respond to people opening up about mental health issues, and how to react to people having an episode. Accept that mental health is just like physical health."
Provide training or resources to educate or normalize health differences
Be more welcoming and supportive. Accept mental health as a non taboo subject and simply a part of life.
I think opening up more conversation around these issues and increasing awareness around mental health would help ease conversations about it
Emphasize more on whole person health as an important goal for all. More posters or ads. 
"Too many people use OCD and ADHD as jokes to describe their tendency or their laziness and lack of desire to pay attention. I know there are some people who have this, but the amount of people who jokingly profess they have it (without diagnosis) make it harder for people to admit they have these things in real life.  In addition, it's less of a direct tech issue than a masculine issue.  Transitive property: Tech is masculine, it's not masculine to admit you have issues, therefore, you don't admit it in tech."
Provide support and educate from the top down ensuring line managers especially are supportive and educated
"teach people how to recognise issues, how to respond and/or how to find the right person to help."
"I think there's a long way to go to make those of us who have a mental health issue feel safe to talk about it. It feel like a risk almost every time right now.

That may be through talking about it more to reduce stigma, or making mental health as commonplace as physical health. Explicit safety statements could be good, as well. 

Personally a large part of why I would hide mental health issues is shame. The stigma of the past is strong."
"make it easier to talk about and get support for. for example, make it company policy that leaving work for therapy or mental health related appointments is okay"
"Society, in general, needs better education about ""invisible"" health matters--both mental and physical!"
"I think the tech industry encourages a very unhealthy, lone-wolf, ""me vs them"" mentality. If someone asks a ?, ""RTFM"" is still a very common attitude. Asking for help from our colleagues is an important part of who we are as humans, and yet  we discourage that in so many ways. I'd like to see fewer lone wolf heroes in the press and more stories about how someone brought a team together and made sure everyone was happy and felt safe discussing things. "
Start-ups often lack the experienced HR people to inform employees about the extent of their benefits
Increased information & explicit support for people with mental health issues or disorders.

Increased awareness 
"Enforce tolerance of diversity more than only X/Y chromosomes and ethnicity.  Arrange broader insurance coverage (eg. couples counseling) without EAP-like hurdles.  Recognize workplace microaggressions and address policies that exacerbate mental health issues:
 Harassment for not turning on a webcam during meetings.
 Company meals are all meat all the time.  Which makes it difficult for the rest of us to not be hungry during travel, repeatedly harassed for not eating, and drawing undue attention.  WeWork addressed this, everyone else can too.  If someone can't go for one @#$@ meal without meat, their ego disorders need to be fixed or fired.
 Stop tolerating and even encouraging bullying, which includes stack ranking. NTT and Cisco, this means YOU."
De-stigmatization.
"Discuss common issues in the workplace - burnout, stress, anxiety."
Be. More. Open.
Mandatory quarterly vacation.
The industry could improve their support for mental health issues by continuing to normalize employees getting support for their issues and providing easy to understand documentation as to what is covered or not under their insurance plans. Also not pushing employees to work themselves to the bone/encouraging and supporting a healthy work life balance is important so that employees have the ability to take time off to deal with things that they need to.
"For software engineers having a depression or a mental illness is almost the equivalent of disability. If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness."
I really don't know. My answer was based on the idea that things can always be better. But I don't know of anything that would say it is currently bad.
More awareness and education
"Not demonize people for social cluelesness.
"
Not sure.
Make it more open to discuss
Be more willing to talk about it - talking about it takes the stigma away. By treating it like any other illness.
"Fucked if I know.  I just don't feel comfortable talking about mental health at work, for fear of bias against me in all future interactions."
Educate themselves. Talk to their employees.
Be less judgemental!
"The most common, significant issue I see in technology is burnout. Working overtime is almost expected in tech. The pace of the industry and projects typically require overtime. Even when management is not advocating for overtime, it is rarely discouraged. Perhaps more could be done to help control overtime for the sake of health."
Better education
"End the ""Bro"" culture. "
"I’ve seen too many burn out cases. This should be easily indentifiable by supervisors, and they should provide support."
"Make people aware of the help available - CBT, counselling, etc"
"Reduce emphasis on competition everywhere: for jobs, for promotions, for “work fame” etc. That makes it fundamentally impossible to open up about weaknesses. Physical issues are now somewhat accepted because of the law (here in UK), assuming they start while already employed, but mental health is still mostly taboo."
"Honestly, I don't even know what industry-wide support would look like.  I'd like to feel comfortable discussing mental health in my own office, but my anxiety might prevent that even in the most supportive of environments."
Encourage empathy - long process
Stop putting profits over people. 
More open campaigns on the topic
"There's the obvious answer of adding mental health coverage to insurance plans, regular talks/presentations about mental health and preservation, and cultivating a more supportive environment surrounding it. But there really isn't a way to remove the stigma. Because no matter how supportive a company is in their programs or message, employers and hiring managers will always have an implicit doubt on an employee/potential hire's ability, work ethic, and reliability if they ever reveal they have a mental health issue."
Treat mental health similarly to physical health
It's hard. It's a brain-centered industry. If your brain isn't working? Are you contributing?
"The industry does not, in general, care about stress anxiety or employee burnout. It’s a well paying field, but ruthlessly Darwinian."
"Be more supportive, believe employees, and offer help before demanding proof."
"I don't feel there is a difference between the tech industry and society in general, at least where I live and work. Awareness, provide resources on mental health disorders, warning signs, how to seek help. Discuss openly."
"There is so much prejudice and biases in the tech industry, i doubt much can be done, probably initiatives to raise awareness. "
"There could be far more awareness of what mental health disorders could impact colleagues, as well as better policing of discriminatory behaviour (including language). Training would be a plus as well."
"Be very explicit about provided mental health benefits, and do so frequently."
Talk and encourage to talk about it. Add or expose mental healthcare.
Be considerably more careful about balancing good intentions with the accuracy and validity of the narrative and actions that are taken.
make it less taboo
Taboo matter
Raise awareness about mental issue and treat mental issue as a physical issue. 
Be more direct and open about supporting employees
"Better training for management and co-workers. Vocal and explicit support for mental health issues, including examples of what positive support looks like; explicit and persistent advertising of mental-health support resources; industry-awards for companies that handle the issue well, or at least more obviously including issues of mental-health support as one of the ""rating"" criteria for ""best places to work"". "
I think they struggle first and foremost with diversity. They think of themselves as a monolith but there are so many different people wanting to get into the industry.
Mental health first aid to be given equal standing to physical first aid.
"Talk about it more (this HAS gotten better), deal with people feeling stigmatized for talking about how they actually feel.

Stop focusing on utilization/productivity as the only metric of success. The goal shouldn't be to find out how much work you can dump on someone before they break."
Help me
"Better support for flexible working arrangements (e.g., remote work, alternative working hours)."
Take it as seriously as physical health support.
More remote work. More part-time work
Get rid of open offices. Agile and more so scrum isn't conducive to any mental health issues and some other forms of disability. 
"Preventative care measures, similar to a yearly physical, but a yearly mental checkup. Hour-long session to talk with someone and see if they can spot anything that could be an issue to them."
"Identify common mental health issues related to work, known causes and how to avoid them"
"A lot of the emphasis on being a ""coding ninja"" or ""unicorn"" places pressure on people to always be productive, always be having good days. On top of impostor syndrome it also means there's a lot of pressure that contributes to anxiety and similar issues."
"More awareness, more training. Mental Health First Aid for all managers."
I think as a whole America does a poor job of being supportive of mental health issues
More training for managers on how to identify and help.
"Ease back in the crunch time for developers, structure the work so employees have time to breathe and communicate calmly"
Making employees comfortable bringing forward issues and that it won't put their job at risk to seek help.
Awareness
I think mental health coverage is usually provided by physical healthcare insurance providers who make it challenging to seek out and receive treatment.
collective bargaining
Explicitly state the steps to seek help. Therapist? General practitioner? Psychiatrist? ERP? There is no clarity about where to start
Talk about it more.
"I don't think people are always taken seriously when they talk about mental health issues unless they are actively in crisis (suicidal, self-harm, etc)"
Not see mental illness as the source of bad things or antsocial issues.
They really need to make mental health awareness a required training for managers and up.
Unsure
Discuss mental health preservation in project planning and team management.
I’m not sure. Destigmatize it. Accept it as part of the human condition. Don’t treat it differently than some physical ailment. 
"Be more organised, less crunch, offer more skill support, let me do my job, and don’t interfere."
"Hours and deadlines seem ridiculous. Work culture of always going 120% isn't helpful. Too competitive. Need more realistic deadlines, proper funding for automation/technology tools that reduce grunt work, better staffed teams, dedicated break-rooms, and at least 10% of the workweek should be mandatory for relevant personal projects or professional development, better mentoring, and mental health support teams."
"More education on mental illness. More consistent coverage for mental health, including therapy, prescriptions, etc."
Decrease working hours and promote work-life balance. Offer professional help as part of benefits package.
They should have proper training of senior management to timely appreciate there subordinate work and do fair review at work place.
"
"
Provide training to employers on how to materially support caregivers.
less pressure to perform.  structure teams to make absence not be an issue
People won’t look at this issue willingly. Most responsive companies make mandatory some kind of evaluation.
Talk openly and offerhelp
Remove the stigma attached to it and treat it like any other ailment
Reduce stigma. Break the silence.
"More promotion of taking mental health days, more support for remote working (travel budgets are never large enough to truly bring everyone together than needed), more ways to build trust an openness in teams."
Flexibility in working practices. Not making it an issue to take time off.
"We need to fix a lot of things, like bad on-call rotations, deal with stress levels"
"Speak about it, take it as a part of life, something to expect to happen at some point in everybody's life"
"I think awareness is key. If we can create an understanding about the conditions that people face, I think it will be much easier to normalize behaviors that support them."
"Where do I start? Stop overworking people, be more open to 4-day work weeks, give people more control over their deliverables, get serious about stopping bullying, stop rewarding unhealthy behaviour such as extreme competitiveness and overwork. Also fix the diversity problem and bro culture. This industry is brutal for women."
Be more transparent in how the company handles mental health issues and what services (if they have them) they have that can support employees effected by this
"Break down the idea that a good/rock star developer is someone who works 80+ hours a week without complaint, without sleep, and without food. Destroy the idea that developers who don't do all of that are expendable."
People that are naturally inclined to work in our industry are notorious for avoiding things that make them uncomfortable.  We all need to get past that and be more open to people discussing mental health issues around us.
"Caveat: I work in the tech industry in Europe, and am a startup co-founder. 

The big danger is Silicon Valley imitation. Silicon Valley, with its cult of over hours and more-than-reasonable dedication to a job (where a job should just be that: a way to creatively express yourself that also pays for your life !) can, and does, drive people into health problems, to put i benignly. 

Still, this is Europe; we have multiple layers of protection: state-provided health insurance, state regulations on what are sane working hours, state -provided emergency services (even for mental health). What helps, too, for sure: the tech industry is rife with highly intelligent people, who are possibly more likely than others to understand and even imagine the mental suffering of a coworker."
"- Making allowances for mental health days in the same way that we allow for sick days.
- Being supportive of a variety of mental health issues instead of making assumptions about what they think they know about issues and disorders.
- Talk more openly about the issues that exist and the appropriate (and inappropriate) responses to them."
free therapy
"Recognize mental illness as a debilitating condition on par with physical injury. De-stigmatize it by discussing it openly and not in a weird, faux-support manner."
"There needs to be more widespread knowledge about
1. how pervasive and normal mental health problems are
2. what legal protections exist around people with mental health problems"
We could be more open. 
give reasonable workload and compensation
Post in their job postings that mental illnesses do not disqualify for employment
"I think there are a lot of available accommodations that make life easier for people with mental illness, such as ability to work from home or set alternate hours, but I think they are not recognized as mental health accommodations specifically or called out as something that can be meaningfully used in this way. "
"Acknowledge it, that it exists and that it's okay to admit it, even anonymously."
Put it on par with physical health. Have leaders talking about mental health openly. 
We need to keep having the conversation about mental wellness so that the stigma is removed and people will take time to take care of their mental health.
Stop CRUSHING PEOPLE WITH RIDICULOUS DEADLINES! 
"I think the high pressure drive in many orgs, like startups, do very poorly. Established companies in the Fortune 500 do better. Fortune 500 companies outside of Tech that have a big tech footprint do the best."
"Stop pushing for insane deadlines and making people stress to extreme levels about everything they do. Push when it is needed, but be flexible. Plan for delays to be possible. Listen to the tech people and their reasonings. Let them find their pace and work to it."
"Include mental health services in employee benefits if they're not included already, and emphasize them if they are. On a team level, managers should be trained in recognizing and responding to mental health issues in direct reports, and assist them in maintaining a work/life balance. If the budget allows, team bonding events and other breaks are always welcome."
treat mental illness like physical illness
"Talk more, more visibility at conferences. "
"More awareness, it's a topic that never being discussed, we know it's there, everyone know, but nobody talks about it, at least not from the management perspective."
3
i dont think it is an industry issue. it is a problem everywhere
"Talk about stress in 1-on-1 conversation, especially for on-call people.

Stop bull-shit slogan ""fast moving startup and comfort does not go together""."
"Talk more about it, but it on the agenda."
hjhjhhj
remove the stigma
Awareness of insurance benefits and good policy around mental health communicated
"I think that the industry could offer more resources for mental health support. The industry could also just talk more about it, in order to break stigma."
"I don't really know specifically in the Tech industry, since I work in health care, I feel it is approached in the right way if that makes sense?"
We could stop fetishizing unhealthy behaviors that seem productive in the short term.
Talk more opening and remove some of the stigma behind it.
"more openness, and that leaders/hr/those in charge learn more about mental health issues, that way they can help spread information and support."
"More awareness, more acceptance. More understanding of how some MHIs and MHDs can be competitive advantages, and how building products that support folks with the above can ALSO be a competitive advantage. "
"I think in my segment of the industry, more of us have had problems or continue to suffer from mental illness. I think the fact that the other people that you work with have dealt with their own issues, the general high intelligence level and the openness to learn helps"
"The industry can discuss mental health - have conversations and end stigma. Also, boundaries need to be set in tech industries from the first interview. A job description with distinct responsibilities and roles should be a must. Pay should be respectful. The bullying and gossiping must stop. "
"
"
Not treating us as coding machines and put worker's health before market trends
3
More open discussion and willingness to accommodate the needs of folks with mental health issues
"Increase awareness, provide support resources"
We should just have more open and honest conversations about it.
"Accept diversity, change culture."
"Acknowledge that - probably more than many careers - tech work is something that employees often take home with them, and work to improve work/life balance"
That it’s human to have mental health issues throughout our lifetime and there are certain circumstances where it’s likely to happen and so they should have an easy way to take up support 
"Talk about and normalize mental health issues.  Help employees understand they should be met with the same understanding as a short-term disabling illness (pneumonia, bad car accident, etc).  Provide guidance to leadership on how to treat mental health issues that affect work schedule or performance.  Give resources to help leaders accommodate, support, and mitigate effects on productivity (generally what they care about most, rather than long-term health)."
Lobby for a single payer healthcare system
To inform employees it is ok to talk about this and that it is as important or even more important than physical health. I don't think anyone unhealthy mentally is going to be motivated to become physically healthy. I know I am not.

workshops / open discussion
"Rather than having self service assistance programs, actually bring this more into tech forums, people talking about their own journeys and success stories. Not overstigmatising or self diagnosing. There is a spectrum of mental health and allowing people access to work through the journey rather than leaving them to sort themselves would be helpful.
More awareness of mental illness forums at tech such as Ignote to ITSMFX"
"quarterly ""wellness"" checks?"
"
"
I really have no idea
"Stop valuing work over non-work time. Stop counting cars in the parking lot after 5pm, Stop scheduling all-hands mandatory meetings for Friday afternoon. Provide more PTO and make sure employees believe that it's important to take. Get rid of ""at will"" employment. Value sensible work practices over ""burning the midnight oil"""
Kinder gentler approach. OCD-like issues are great thing as a skill/trait for employers but can be a downer for the employee
More awareness maybe
"To continue speaking honestly when going through something, especially as a boss. To recognize when they are working long hours, and sending high demands with no space for air/time off. The boss sets the culture and if they continue to just say ""take care of yourself"" but don't make the actions for their team to do so or for their selves to do so, nothing will change. And to make sure the support resources available to them are actually working. That employees know where to go, can afford them and enjoy the care provided. I see to often money being thrown at services that are not properly audited or communicated to the team."
Create a real pragmatic awareness when  it is possible and presidpose structures
Less working time per person.
More and more people are talking about it including luminaries.  I applaud these efforts.  Setting better examples is really important.  Mental health is health and should be treated just the same by employers taking a responsibility for their workers' well being.
"better training, education, awareness campaigns"
More in - office resources/counselors. Training for managers and leaders. More recognition/discussion in business conversation.
"Open communication about it, no barriers/ease of access"
Be more open and inclusive. Create safe spaces where people with mental health issues feel like they can openly talk about their issues without feeling stigmatized.
Tell em its ok.
People talking more openly about it and giving the same importance as physical health
"It's hard for me to say as someone fairly neurotypical, but actively encouraging awareness and respect is good."
I think talking about it more in general would be helpful so that it makes it more common and therefore more acceptable to talk about.  
Increase awareness and bring there topic of mental health into the light
We're starting the conversation at this point but there's still a ton of stigma around it. Especially the bro-culture in SF is heavily negative on it. That comes across in jokes about ADHD and more. 
Limit peoples stress and working hours.
"I did not see any steps to prioritise mental health wellbeing for IT workers. I had to go through hundreds of policy files, but none of them were related to mental health issues or disorder. Even one of my employer would not allow taking time off for GP appointments. We have to take A/L for the time spent for the appointments. Which, even for physical health, is not helpful at all."
There should be a mental health professional who can deal with day to day stresses of the employees. 
I'd like to see us provide better support for people who work in higher-stress environments such as on-call support.  We're starting to see people discuss the negative effects of long hours and stressful situations... but we should double down on that.
Tech is an industry that I believe neuro-diversr people are given more opportunities to thrive in than many other industries. I wish that that same acceptance and attitude was directed at individuals suffering from disorders and mental health issues. 
"have some periodic func activities. And have an doctor one to one meeting with an employee , once per year"
make discussions about that. provide a balanced rythm of workers with mental health disorder/issues
.
poderiam nos tratar menos como maquinas e mais como pessoas. O capitalismo no geral nos força a ser extremamente produtivo e nas áreas de TI essa pressão é ainda maior
"When there's an elephant in the room introduce him. The industry has to look at it, not avoid talking about it. Meanwhile, i think people have to  strengthen personality. Maybe when we feel stronger we will change environment around. At last, we are humans not machines."
"Talking about, always"
"IT in general is a Very demanding area, and specially on some cases having no work/life balance is mandatory"
I think that's openness and liberty to bring up those kind of conversation is a great way to start this support
Understand each case and seek the best options. 
"Home office, life quality"
-
"Make psychological safety more important than producing results, and take time to check in with employees to see if they need help or breaks. "
Supportive talks
Make sure that the person is not burdened with too much work and the expectations are set real while helping him grow in the desired field
"better time and money management. less racism overall and particularly indian brahmin concepts. if girls could fake love boys for some time with the contract signed, that too will help."
No idea
I have no idea.
be more open and transparent by actively organizing and leading discussion
There's a lot of talk about it but _hello?!_ I'm right here - and I have NEVER felt supported. It needs to not just be talk or a press release.
it's over hyped
Stop glorifying overwork and stress
"I think there should be groups dedicated to supporting mental health in the workplace, like how there are groups to address diversity and inclusion. There should be sessions to inform employees of mental health issues and go over what the company offers to help with these issues. Mental health should be brought up more so it’s not so taboo."
"Tech industry work culture is at its basis still a machismo culture. If you can't pull your capitalist weight at all times, you aren't valuef. Unless this fundamentally shifts, the environment will remain unsupportive."
I am not certain.
Send out an email to all with info on ombré yo contact HR
A way to reduce blame. It’s not my fault. And I’m doing the best I can. 
I don't know.
Stop treating mental illness like it's a plague when it's actually very common.
I think the issue is farther reaching than just the tech industry. I don't think we're any better or worse at it than the greater global ciommunity.
Provide meaningful access to mental health care (as part of broader health care access) AND stop discriminating/firing employees based on mental health issues alone. 
"Ensure teams have access to adequate stress relief programs, have open dialogue with team members (as managers/ leaders) about mental health needs, have an HR section during on-boarding specifically about how we handle mental health, accommodations examples we've made, instructions on how to best talk about mental health. "
be forward solution focused instead of punitive 
The support should be there and it should be treated the same way as any other health problem.
Remove stigma
They could try to improve the interviewing process.
Encourage understanding mental health and sensitize employees
taking periodic surveys and taking actions 
Offer support and counselling
bfdzd
Normalizing the idea of mental health as a priority for the company - making it clear that the company can only thrive if its employees can.
"Take an active interest in the person and tailor the approach to the needs of the individual. One size fits all offerings of gym membership and health insurance is nothing more than a HR box ticking exercise. Providing access to counseling services would probably be more beneficial. In 26 years of being in the industry I have never once availed of the services of a gym. I used to cycle to work every day and it was great physical exercise and also a chance to clear my mind. In the past year I have attended a counselor and have found it very beneficial, my only regret is that I didn't have the opportunity or wasn't aware of it's benefits 20+ years ago. Helping people identify and deal with issues they are experiencing would be of huge benefit to an organisation. In addition to making the affected individual happier about themselves, they would be more productive in an environment where they felt they as an individual were cared about."
Create an atmosphere where it feels normal to have some issues
Ask... encourage. Give an actual shit.
"Awareness, advocacy ,"
"I think that they could be more supportive, clear up any misconceptions that other employees might have and activly look for employees that may be suffering a mental health issue such as depression to get them help before it's too late"
"More awareness and support for mental health at industry events and conferences (quiet/recharge rooms, information on who you could contact if you're experiencing overwhelm and just need to talk)"
"employee mental health needs to become part of the culture to be effective and valued. since people management is the center of culture, all industry needs to treat mental health support as it is: a transformative and additional value for the employer."
"Awareness campaigns. Build trust of acceptance for such employees.
Explain provisions of support policies for such situations"
My impression is that the subject is avoided. Deadlines and requirements could be less strict to promote overall better health.
I have no idea.
Be more open about mental health and allow employees the time off to seek help
Tech industry sometimes tends to be less open for people's weaknesses and individual strength because of a high level of abstraction in our daily work. It would help to actively see people as people and not as some kind of technical translator.
Talk about it more.  Have leadership share their issues to help de-stigmatize it.
awareness
A lot. Especially in the US.
"Make it less taboo and provide explicit activities to combat it. Pressures of the industry force people to overly exert and stress which leads to lake of sleep, less exercise, less time away, and more burnout"
"It begins with banishing a toxic culture that has deep, deep roots."
Put better systems in place to prevent burnout due to systemic emotional labor forced onto URMs
Burnout is a huge issue. There needs to be better encouragement or even incentive for work-life balance.
All areas
"Educate themselves, invest on stress relieving activities, accept health leave just because ""I am not feeling mentally well"""
"Talk about it, offer benefits, and normalize it."
"stop judging, offer better insurance coverage and offer in-house counseling."
At least to start caring about mental health
"1) Awareness. Start discussing it more. 
2) Support. Offer onsite counseling. Offer online counseling. 
3) Make all of these available with anonymity."
"Clearly defined policies, unquestionable time off paid, more awareness, less ""cute washing"" (pet a dog, do some yoga, color a picture) and more understanding that a lot of people are dealing with issues that can't be solved by petting a dog. Free employer paid subscription to apps such as Sanvello."
The industry should know what kind of stress/problems happens at the workplace.
More openess
Treat mental illness with as much sensitivity as a physical illness is treated.
... I'm not sure
Fix the damn cultures. stay true to cultural values that support humanity
Not sure
Supervisors should try and break the ice with employees for such discussions so that employee gets the comfort to share his issues with his manager.

raise awareness
reduce stigma. offer options for part time work. not use an EAP as their only mental health coverage.
They should understand and we should talk openely
behaving well with them and give them a good time for there task to complete. give them time to complete the task.

"Mental health counseling should be provided as a default part of all employment, not just provided as an option."
"need to consider individual circumstances like age , family structure when pressurizing for deadlines."
The workload on the employees should not be too much. Daily working hours should not be fixed and flexible working hours should be applied. Mobbing should not be applied on employees. Social activities should be organized. Every employee manager should receive sincere well done.
openness
"Frequently announce or discuss a positive, practical, and very (extremely) rational viewpoint and ""framework"" for conceptualizing and identifying mental health issues, and adopt and publicize a very (explicitly) rational, believable system for handling screening and treatment referrals along with evidence of good protection of confidentiality and successful work accommodations or other positive dispositions."
Increase paid benefits. Remove stigma.
"Make it part of onboarding and training, just like all the other OSHA and health stuff they drill you on. And of course, stop intentionally burning employees out by working them as hard as possible and letting them go as soon as they can't keep up."

More open conversation
less hours
"Examine effects of hours, feedback methods, and targets."

this person is not fit to work
"Mental health issues can be very difficult in the tech industry. We typically work in small, fast paced teams. There are huge pressures on us to deliver quickly that mean we rarely have time to write quality code. It makes it very difficult to work with people with Mental Health issues as you really need to spend quality time with them and you can't be in a rush to do it. Companies need to be willing to invest in people and give them the time they require to work effectively and not just quickly.."
Make mental-health-related accommodations a norm
"Mental health disorders are a hard thing to accept both as a male and as a person who wants to be ""above"" health problems. I think keeping mental health at the forefront of our minds, especially in 2020 but probably beyond, as something that is classified as the same kind of ""necessary day off"" as being physically ill is important. Beating employees over the head (metaphorically) with resources they can use and continuing to broadcast success stories from either brave self-identifying folks or anonymous folks de-mystifies the problem and may motivate others to see that there is support and ""a way forward"" rather than suffering and potentially unhealthy coping reinforced by a culture of ""dealing with it yourself""."
"Any tech industries are very professionals, they never work with emotions. They just want their work to complete for what you have been paid. Only few organizations are taking care of their employees like family."
Acknowledge that men aren't disposable.
more information dissemination
keep stress free workplace
"Be supportive, talk openly"
giving short time breaks for the employees after a certain task is done
There must be some mental health check camps similar to physical health check. more education is required on mental health disorders with case studies.
LEAVE DOESNT NEED EXPLANATION. JUST APPLY LEAVE
Be more open minded and supportive
This is still not treated as important in organizations.
"Stop crunch culture, encourage more awareness of mental health"
"Openness, eliminate the taboo."
Create more awareness. Work Life Balance. Encourage people to open out when faced with challenges. Train Managers / HR to have a sympathetic view
"govt should enforce a strict law, otherwise in india nobody cares about their employees. they treat us as slave"
Make it a part of the workplace wellness program
"Raise awareness about symptoms of such diseases for self diagnosis
Set -up anonymous counselling camps for employees
Provide coverage in medical insurance policies for mental health issues
set up support groups to help employees with mental health conditions"
Skip
They can reduce the work loads
"Offer them to talk about issues, fitness offers in breaks or also after work events, healthy food, quiet rooms for working, couches and chill-out areas"
"Empathy and be a better human being. When you don´t judge people for what they suffer, it is easier to want to help others. Regarding the employers and industry, bring more awareness to the issues, offer confidentiality and a support line."
"new to the industry, unsure"
Promoting mental health activities among employees
"Everyone is unique, and many of us have slightly different brains. The industry could benefit greatly from tapping into the strengths of this diversity and creating safe, productive environments. Hiring people in tech is hard and there is a lot of competition, we need to take care of employees so that churn goes down and mental health support can go a long way."
"Be more respectful and understanding of mental health issues in general, and adjust an employee's work in accordance with his needs."
Talk about it more. I think that's the biggest thing we can do to normalize it.
"South Africa is a strange place where mental health problems are a weakness in personality or strength, I think by listening, observing and where needs be offering counselling / training or even a day off just to try and regain some stability."
"Realize breaks are needed, break-neck pace not always needed, break trend/perception of IT people as socially inverted to encourage social interaction."
"Explicitly state that mental health issues present as valid a reason for taking a sick day as physical health issues.

Just talk about it in a way that recognizes the issue without forcing people to disclose their own struggles.

Make a clear statement in the companies mission statement, employee handbook, etc. that mental health is taken seriously and is a priority."
Cut down on stress
Can't say anything at this moment on this issue
"The industry tends to run extremely tight on staff for any company, I think increasing the IT staff at most companies will help alleviate pressure."
"Raise awareness, offer proactive support, reduce stigmas surrounding mental health."
"Tech is about turn and burn.  Employees are run into the ground.  If they burn out, the company just hires the next batch of college grads (they know the latest tech anyway right?).  We need mental health awareness at work, we need leaders that will speak about their issues, and we need policy and culture that actively encourages employees to protect their mental health."
Less preconception. Most common issues can be treated or dont frequently interfere with the work in the industry.
Realizing that spending a lot of hours in front of a computer per example is not funny or comfortable
"The industry supports people with mental health issues if it is temporal issue and there is hope for a complete recovery. Otherwise, the person is considered burned and reduce to basic non critical operations."
Don’t know
Making awareness about mental health support available in organization
"More leadership speaking vulnerably about mental health experiences. Avoiding toxic positivity and embracing validating feelings, encouraging people to take more time off, denouncing hustle culture in tech."
"Encourage ""unplugging"". Draw clear lanes between work and private life."
"Mental health issues range from Very Serious to Minor but Still Not Helpful- all parts of that spectrum are legit, and understanding that anyone can suffer from any of them at any time and you may not know, and that it's ok to not be ok is important. Mental health applies to everyone."
"Continuously remind where help can be found and being supportive of it. Also, make sure the culture in the company is supportive in all regards, not only for mental health."
work pressure and time management is very important. also leaders attitude to handle the communication with employees.
"More balance.  People work from many time zones and many odd schedules, creating the illusion of 24/7 workdays.  People see others texting/emailing at wee hours and think they need to too.  Leadership rewards ""effort"" and ""hard work"" more often than quality.  It's a vicious cycle.  I'd love to see a manager hand out a team reward to an individual for their achievement of doing good work while only logging 40 hours (or less)."
"First, stop discriminating openly against females and certain foreigners.  Until that changes, I see more refined and nuanced improvements as nearly impossible."
"Your they should support, there should be camp for this every 3 Montha"
"In tech industry the mental health is better than other. Half of the mental issues come up due to over expectation from current job  and salary and rest is personal [family] issues. This industry want everything in a person great tech knowledge, communication, Personality wheras most of the people have 1 one those. Next reason of mental issue is favoritism, office groups that makes a below average jumping ladders. There is lot of show off and less work its increasing day by day."
Create and foster support groups for employees.
offers for anonymous psychological counseling
Limit work timings strictly.
developers are rarely treated as people...more like a code factory
"Instead of obtuse attempts at supporting mental health ""in general"" with programs from HR, build trust by attempting to break down the stigma of discussing mental health in the workplace. Have conversations about mental health well being and education as an important part of being a good employee."
Every company is willing to help with mental health which is mention in the company policies. But when it comes to implementation it is bad
Do not press so hard or force extra hours of work. Bringing lectures to encourage discussion on mental health.
"normalize all forms of mental therapy. congratulate those within an organization (who wish to do so) who openly admit to using mental therapy and openly encourage therapy for those who might need it. too often, while trying to be a progressive company, vacations will be congratulated and encouraged as a form of stress relief. therapy should be part of every company's health care package and resources for finding and booking a therapy appointment should be made as easily as possible."
"Developing strategies and plaforms to help people with mental illnesses and raising awareness. Making it clear that, as my supportive employer said ""it's like if you break a leg, there's nothing wrong about that"""
"Reductions in stress, reduction in hero mentalities, less capitalism..."
try to make this posible
More discussion. Emphasize mental health as important as physical health
none
"less pressure, easier deadlines, more empathetic managers"
It's normal to focus on work and deadlines over employees' well-being
"The biggest thing that needs to do is to talk about it.  Talk about it with coworkers, employers, and employees."

No clue
Spread more awareness and provide counselling to those who need it as part of health benefits
"I've met a lot of people with slight OCD, anxiety, or social anxiety in tech so I think we accept it more even if we don't directly say/support  person"
"The industry and employers tend to push towards overwork and stress which trigger and exacerbate existing conditions. I think clear understandings of time off and providing employees time to deal with their mental health issues is a huge first step. Secondly, I think this needs to be active support and encouragement for folks to get used to taking advantage of it and understanding it is OK to say ""no"" to additional work and responsibilities that will cause mental health challenges. 

Open Offices can contain additional challenges for neurodiverse folk."
Educate employees more on Mental Health issues and ways to overcome them. Talk openly about it.
Consider it equal to physical health
1. By providing online or in person helpline/ doctor appointment based on mental health.
"First, decrease the occupation of people. 100% occupation is not healthy, it is abusive.
Second, mental health awareness campaigns.
Third, provide formal support to those in need."
"Be better informed, more supportive and less judgemental."
Better manage the potential for burnout
Tech insdustry is demanding and often the mental health issues are relegated as stress is a norm. More awarenes and support and less discrimination
Make it formally accepted as a problem
"Understand that the tech industry is very very hard to deal with. We stay up late hours and work early mornings. Mental health deserves a light to be shed upon, because we have families that we also affect."

"I think, on the whole, tech people are a little more ""odd ducks"" and it's kind of expected that we'll be a little outside the norm. I've seen some companies proud of the fact. MailChimp (not an employer I have ever worked for) advertises the quirky work force in its recruiting materials. I've seen CEOs giving tours of the office say things like ""this is Joe, one of our top engineers. He's a little awkward and can't hold a conversation - brilliant people like him are like that sometimes."""
"I think de-stigmatizing conversations about mental health would be a great step in the right direction. I know there are usually resources or places to get help, but opening up about mental health at work would be nice."
Discuss and show their support openly. Let the team know that they will provide medical help too.
provide a life coach
Give the employee time if they need to seek for medical help
"Seriously, we need to give people sick AND mental health paid time off SEPARATE from vacation pto. We should not have to choose between vacation and mental health days. Managers need to be trained to understand mental health. They need to understand that if you feel like shit sitting at your desk and trying to force yourself to work will only make things worse and won’t help the employee OR THE COMPANY"
be open
"Change work culture. Billable hours and timesheets are a false and pointless dataset. Work life balance is a sham. Flexibility is a double edged sword. 8 hour work days are arbitrary inventions with a history steeped in human rights movements to prevent capitalist abuse, not grounded in science or a sense of productivity or purpose. Time management and productivity hacking is all a traffic driving click bait farce. We should be adopting target driven business and staff management/ reporting approaches (which hopefully I'll get to build for one day if I don't kill myself first...). We are humans. We are messy and broken and that's supposed to be what makes life glorious, but instead of just quietly pursuing ""enough"", we're chained to our desks in an effort to protect our families well being in a sycophantic attempt to grab the proverbial dangled carrot from whoever sits above us in the food chain, who yells down  ""ENOUGH is just a little bit more"". Personally, I'd rather be dead, but I've got mouths to feed..."
They could provide psychologist sessions available to all employees
Walk the talk
"Yes, I observed"
I have loans to pay which makes me work harder. Since my employer pays me very little it makes my life uncomfortable to meet my ends. This shall extend my working hours thus affecting my mental health.
interactive sessions
fff
"encourage wellness days, encourage open conversation, encourage team bonding so individuals feel comfortable interacting on a personal level with coworkers, make mental health a priority in healthcare plans, promote work life balance, offer work from home days, flexible work hours"
Just stop thinking that having a mental issue is pretty same as having a psychical issue.
"I think sometimes it can be hard. We work long hourse and people are often very competitive, which might led to a toxic workspace. I think companies should have a culture which prevents this, starting from the VPs and Directors. This means toxic people won't be hired or prometed to positions where soft skills are a must."
Don't know
Seriously limit deadlines and pressures
"The tech industry is notorious for crunch and overworking employees. I think the industry could work to have a 40-hour work week and make sure employees have time to relax.

The industry could also provide an open dialogue about mental health. Letting employees that are struggling know they won't be penalized goes a long way towards letting them get the help and treatment they need."
Value the assets (resources) they have and protect them as much as they look at other cost cutting activities
speaking
Yes
Acknowledge it is real and provide safe spaces to get help or just talk
"More advocacy, resources, accommodations and discussions"
Take away the pressure. I essentially mean that employers have unrealistic goals/deadlines etc. and employees definitely suffer from this
"Make mental as forefront as physical health, make people comfortable discussing it openly and reduce the stigma associated with it."
"The tech industry can either ignore or take advantage of mental health issues, but RARELY just accepts them"
Frequent Seminars
accept difference and integrate woman managers
Address mental health issues as opportunities to improve the employer/industry by making people a better investment.
more discussions
Make it normal to talk about mental health. Make support resources available.
Openly brief their support level on the joining day and encourage employee to open up time to time.
"Big tech giants need to more, openly and encourage all to do their part. Just like some companies select vendors who may be doing some Go Green initiatives, or awarding to minority owned businesses, they can also award businesses that does their part in this mental health area. In other words, encourage, directly and indirectly."
Make it Mental Health policies part of onboarding.

"The first thing is to make any person on what level in the company feeling safe to open up about the issues the person is facing.

In the teams I've been working at our current company we do try to make the team as safe as possible so that anybody will be able to open up and discuss the issues they're facing."
discuss the topic openly

Empathy Training
no comment
Less deadlines. We are overworked.
"It cant happen, because there is a lot of work, i am not sure someone will worry a lot and waste a lot of time with the employees"
"Team buildings, provide sport membership, visit seminars on mental health importance"
more awareness programs...more on site meetings with counsellors
Give information about mental health support at the beginning of employment.
A consistent awareness campaign and conscious support/assistance
"I believe that the entire mental health issue needs to be seriously addressed in this country to be more accepting and less stigmatizing.  I don't know if there's anything that an employer could do to make things more supportive, short of having a zero tolerance policy for anyone who retaliates at someone due to a mental health issue."
"Acknowledge that mental health has to be a priority, make time and space for employees to seek treatment. Choose health plans that cover mental health and the less common prescriptions"
initiate more mental awareness program plus health benefits phyiscal activity like sports etc to engage employess  to enjoy  the work place and stand with the employees in tough time like recession job loss etc
"The industry has large numbers of conferences. I went to one recently where someone had a session discussing having anxiety and depression as a developer. The room was packed. If every tech conference had 1-2 sessions like that and offered people websites to go to, we could change attitudes."
dsdsd
"I think there is some solid general awareness of mental health issues in the tech industry, but I think there is a lack of understanding around _how_ mental health manifests itself in individuals. What my depression does to me is nothing like how that might impact another person. I feel like people don't like dealing with those messy aspects of mental health"
Continue to de-stigmatise this topic.  This might include having a mental health day off and openly discuss this item.  Have key leadership discuss this in a sensitive manner.
Tech industry tends to overwork which can exacerbate mental health issues
offer openness to talk about it and also offer means of help to employees.
"reduce high insurance deductibles/better health plans. And provide time off, esp if working long hours"
Education and discussion. Managerial policies for handling direct reports with mental health issues. Mental wellness days as a separate category of sick days.
"talk, discuss, anonymity"
Find out why people get their problems and try to prevent it.
..
More open communication and discussion
Better healthcare benefits
"Make it OK to talk about mental illness and remove the stigma. Make sure employees know about mental health resources. Provide accommodations such as flexible schedules and work locations,"
Be bigger advocates for mental health.
let people talk. listen.
nil
"it's trivial or novel support that sometimes presents itself as disingenuous. ""look how diverse and inclusive we are!"" etc."
Yes
"More flexibility with schedules, clearer responsibilities, less multitasking"
"talk, Knowledge
training
experts to turn to"
"Do not stigmatize depression or burnout. 
Learn about the red flags and warning signs, to avoid either before it happens. High achieved individuals who are well respected in their fields, should openly speak about their experiences (if they want to of course) to make the way for the newcomers."
Normalize mental health issues and the discussion of them
more awareness
"I feel, the community, as a whole, could broaden their capacity for listening to, and accepting people's lived experience."
I really don't know since I've always sought help even before I joined the industry so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
be more caring and understanding and nonjudgmental
"they dont seem affected by it ,much, till its really bad"
"Similar to step challenges, they should start Yoga, Meditation, Breathing Exercises challenges and rewards"
"Educate about risks always, not only durring pandemy"
I have no suggestions. It's not an easy solution.
ORGANISE WORKSHOPS TO EDUCATE THEIR EMPLOYERS ON IT USING EXPERTS ON THE FIELD AND LESS PRESSURE ON THE EMPLOYEES
"There is a lot of talk about mental health, but in my years of tech I have not seen behavioral changes in companies. Everywhere I have worked I have seen, and experienced, burnout. It seems to be an accepted part of the tech culture now. Don't tell employees to 'take time off and relax', while keeping unreasonably high expectations on their deliveries."
They can offer certain benefits that would help employees with mental health problems.
"I think raising awareness of what a mental illess or disorder even is would be very valuable.  Tech industry tends to have high paid jobs that comes with a lot of ""must achieve and grow"". This push might and i believe will increase mental problems. Not everyone wants to get bigger and bigger scope. We must recognize also the people who are ""really great at what they do"""
They should be aware of employees family in short.
"I think most employers are selfish. To them, if the employee has any disorders or disabilities that might get in the way of productivity or become a liability, the employer would rather let that employee go and hire someone else. The only thing preventing the discriminatory firing of employees with disabilities are legal regulations."
Respect the employee's personal time and health conditions in general. Stop thinking of tech workers like robots or worker ants. And stop expecting software devs to somehow spend all their personal time working on projects or training on something the employer needs.
I feel like all employers want is results and they don't want any delays whatsoever
Uncertain
"The biggest impact would be to show the support for employees by providing guidance, anonymity if needed etc"
Mandate organized group lectures on mental health issues so 1. it will be anonymous if you want to go 2. it will generate discussion and enter the term into the everyday discussion 3. provide anonymous health care by giving private health policiy that the company has no right to look into
"Open talks, lighter schedules, more forgiving, less rushing"
"Not expect people to work 90 hour weeks? Not extolling the virtues of ""fast paced environments""? Not putting the expectation that every applicant is a 10x rockstar? But of course companies want the best of the best, not me."
gqcfvq
Provide more mental health benefits and work to reduce stigma
Probably have a positive outlook for the future of the individual
"Be open. This includes introspection into one's own mental state, and then be willing to communicate and empathize with others"
"Preventative care and normalizing struggle. I think as a society we have this aversion to being uncomfortable and we pathologize natural human experience. In tech, there's this constant drive for ""bigger, stronger, faster"" which now is becoming increasingly offset with these crash vacations of nothingness. There's no balance. Not to mention the isolation and lack of routine and connection that so many in tech deal with. Intense pressure on deliverables. So many these days, including me, have horrible executive functioning skills and try to white-knuckle grip performance. Also, I believe the amount of substance use, especially stimulants is completely under-reported."
people bring their true self to work and I love that

"This is what I wish I had at my first job - 

1. As part of employee orientation, include sessions on mental health and wellness
2. Stress the importance of taking breaks 
3. Make blog posts on organizational intranet about how it is okay to go through difficult times
4. Provide/ link to resources to manage mental health
5. Have monthly non-work related events for socialization with colleagues, even something as simple as stepping out for coffee as a team."
na
Continue to be open about this being an issue within tech
"We need to change people's minds about what the capabilities of people with mental illness are. Just because you have mental illness, does not mean ytou are resigned to a life that is sad, disconnected, difficult, or unprosperous. People need to understand that talking about these perceptions are the only way to change them."
"Better work-life balance, greater discussions around mental health and working with neurodiverse colleagues, campaigns and support for a variety of mental health issues and disorders (ex: I find that when mental health IS discussed it's often referring only to treating anxiety or depression, not other diagnoses that can be more complicated to explain)."
Explicitly stating that sick leave includes mental health. Encouraging flexible work hours
Destigmatize the diagnosis and allow people to be more open about it.
No-copay visits for therapy
I don't think mental health is taken very seriously by the industry as a whole
Move past the myth of meritocracy.
Help employer to balance life and work
idk
"The industry seems stuck in two modes: 1) Mental Health is a person problem, we don't talk about it, keep it to yourself. 2) Things like OCD and AD(H)D make better developers and DevOps engineers - their mental health issues are a super power, not a liability!!"
"Instead of organizing yoga sessions, work with mental health professionals to understand how different types of employees respond to different scenarios and what can be done to support their mental health"
"Start conversations, offer medical support."
Talk about it more and take it seriously. I develop better when my head is level-headed and not depressive.
Not treat us like machines.
"Maybe they should hold easy to access counselling sessions for people in need, make it mandatory for every person to attend one such session once a week where people are taught about mental health and can openly share their stories"
It would be nice to have meters or a way to mesure the serenity and tranquillity. Also days reserved for the mental health breifing and self care workshops.
Less work load and more gratifications
"Encourage use of tools that have been proven effective like yoga, mindfulness, etc with a programs to pay for membership to apps/classes. Tackle work life balance. I'm at 75-90 hours a week and it's hard on family."
"Talk withe employees, and create a positive environment"
Offer or let folks know that there are mental health benefits available and how to access them
"It seems to me that bad management makes a huge impact on people's mental health. It is where all the unnecessary pressure starts, the unnecessary short deadlines, the frequent change of priority. I think having the industry pacing down, respecting the processes, and giving people reasonable deadlines, would make a great difference. Other than that, a more humane HR, open channels for discussing mental health and more flexible vacation/sick days would represent a good change."
"Support them , and provide less stress time for work"
